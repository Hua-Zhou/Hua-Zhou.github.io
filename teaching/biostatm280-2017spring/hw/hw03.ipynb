    "According to standard Markov chain theory, the (random) position of the surfer converges to the stationary distribution $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)^T$ of the Markov chain. $x_i$ has the natural interpretation of the proportion of times the surfer visits page $i$ in the long run. Therefore $\\mathbf{x}$ serves as page ranks: a higher $x_i$ means page $i$ is more visited. It is well-known that $\\mathbf{x}$ is the left eigenvector corresponding to the top eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$. That is $\\mathbf{P}^T \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}$. Therefore $\\mathbf{x}$ can be solved as an eigen-problem. Show that it can also be cast as solving a linear system. Remember $\\mathbf{x}$ is a distribution so we normalize it to have $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$."
