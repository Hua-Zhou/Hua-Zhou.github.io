## Announcements

* Quiz 1 graded and returned.

* HW1 graded. Merge the pull request from the `grading` branch to your `master` branch. Pull request is also a perfect place for discussion about the grading.

## Feedback on HW1

* [Q3](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/hw/hw01sol.html#Q3): `@fastmath`

* [Q5](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/hw/hw01sol.html#Q5): `readdlm` and `readcsv` are useful for reading tabulated data in text files. Collinearity is a concern from the descriptive statistics.

* [Q6](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2017spring/hw/hw01sol.html#Q6): Looping order. Julia storage is column-major, so `ji` looping is peferred over `ij` looping.

* Use `.gitignore` to exclude files from version control. For example, putting a line `*/.ipynb_checkpoints` in `.gitignore` ignores auxillary files generated by Jupyter notebook.
