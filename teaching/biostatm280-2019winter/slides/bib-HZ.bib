@article{LiXuZhouLi18TuckerReg,
	Abstract = {Neuroimaging data often take the form of high-dimensional arrays, also known as tensors. Addressing scientific questions arising from such data demands new regression models that take multidimensional arrays as covariates. Simply turning an image array into a vector would both cause extremely high dimensionality and destroy the inherent spatial structure of the array. In a recent work, Zhou et al. (J Am Stat Assoc, 108(502):540--552, 2013) proposed a family of generalized linear tensor regression models based upon the CP (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) decomposition of regression coefficient array. Low-rank approximation brings the ultrahigh dimensionality to a manageable level and leads to efficient estimation. In this article, we propose a tensor regression model based on the more flexible Tucker decomposition. Compared to the CP model, Tucker regression model allows different number of factors along each mode. Such flexibility leads to several advantages that are particularly suited to neuroimaging analysis, including further reduction of the number of free parameters, accommodation of images with skewed dimensions, explicit modeling of interactions, and a principled way of image downsizing. We also compare the Tucker model with CP numerically on both simulated data and real magnetic resonance imaging data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in finite sample performance.},

	Abstract = {Complex disorders are typically characterized by multiple phenotypes. Analyzing these phenotypes jointly is expected to be more powerful than dealing with one of them at a time. A recent approach (O'Reilly et al. 2012) is to regress the genotype at a SNP marker on multiple phenotypes and apply the proportional odds model. In the current research, we introduce an explicit expression for the score test statistic and its non-centrality parameter that determines its power. Same simulation studies as those reported in Galesloot et al. (2014) were conducted to assess its performance. We demonstrate by theoretical arguments and simulation studies that, despite its potential usefulness for multiple phenotypes, the proportional odds model method can be less powerful than regular methods for univariate traits. We also introduce an implementation of the proposed score statistic in an R package named iGasso.},

@article{OReilly12MultiPhen,
	Abstract = {The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has discovered hundreds of genetic variants associated with diseases and quantitative traits. However, despite clinical overlap and statistical correlation between many phenotypes, GWAS are generally performed one-phenotype-at-a-time. Here we compare the performance of modelling multiple phenotypes jointly with that of the standard univariate approach. We introduce a new method and software, MultiPhen, that models multiple phenotypes simultaneously in a fast and interpretable way. By performing ordinal regression, MultiPhen tests the linear combination of phenotypes most associated with the genotypes at each SNP, and thus potentially captures effects hidden to single phenotype GWAS. We demonstrate via simulation that this approach provides a dramatic increase in power in many scenarios. There is a boost in power for variants that affect multiple phenotypes and for those that affect only one phenotype. While other multivariate methods have similar power gains, we describe several benefits of MultiPhen over these. In particular, we demonstrate that other multivariate methods that assume the genotypes are normally distributed, such as canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and MANOVA, can have highly inflated type-1 error rates when testing case-control or non-normal continuous phenotypes, while MultiPhen produces no such inflation. To test the performance of MultiPhen on real data we applied it to lipid traits in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966). In these data MultiPhen discovers 21% more independent SNPs with known associations than the standard univariate GWAS approach, while applying MultiPhen in addition to the standard approach provides 37% increased discovery. The most associated linear combinations of the lipids estimated by MultiPhen at the leading SNPs accurately reflect the Friedewald Formula, suggesting that MultiPhen could be used to refine the definition of existing phenotypes or uncover novel heritable phenotypes.},

@article{Morris10MNRegGWAS,
	Abstract = {Abstract The ultimate goal of genome-wide association (GWA) studies is to identify genetic variants contributing effects to complex phenotypes in order to improve our understanding of the biological architecture underlying the trait. One approach to allow us to meet this challenge is to consider more refined sub-phenotypes of disease, defined by pattern of symptoms, for example, which may be physiologically distinct, and thus may have different underlying genetic causes. The disadvantage of sub-phenotype analysis is that large disease cohorts are sub-divided into smaller case categories, thus reducing power to detect association. To address this issue, we have developed a novel test of association within a multinomial regression modeling framework, allowing for heterogeneity of genetic effects between sub-phenotypes. The modeling framework is extremely flexible, and can be generalized to any number of distinct sub-phenotypes. Simulations demonstrate the power of the multinomial regression-based analysis over existing methods when genetic effects differ between sub-phenotypes, with minimal loss of power when these effects are homogenous for the unified phenotype. Application of the multinomial regression analysis to a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes, with cases categorized according to body mass index, highlights previously recognized differential mechanisms underlying obese and non-obese forms of the disease, and provides evidence of a potential novel association that warrants follow-up in independent replication cohorts.

@article{LiZhou17svt,
	Abstract = {Many statistical learning methods such as matrix completion, matrix regression, and multiple response regression estimate a matrix of parameters. The nuclear norm regularization is frequently employed to achieve shrinkage and low rank solutions. To minimize a nuclear norm regularized loss function, a vital and most time-consuming step is singular value thresholding, which seeks the singular values of a large matrix exceeding a threshold and their associated singular vectors. Currently MATLAB lacks a function for singular value thresholding. Its built-in svds function computes the top r singular values/vectors by Lanczos iterative method but is only efficient for sparse matrix input, while aforementioned statistical learning algorithms perform singular value thresholding on dense but structured matrices. To address this issue, we provide a MATLAB wrapper function svt that implements singular value thresholding. It encompasses both top singular value decomposition and thresholding, handles both large sparse matrices and structured matrices, and reduces the computation cost in matrix learning algorithms.},

	Abstract = {Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set tests have been a powerful method in analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The popular sequence kernel association test (SKAT) method tests a set of variants as random effects in the linear mixed model setting. Its P-value is calculated based on asymptotic theory that requires a large sample size. Therefore, it is known that SKAT is conservative and can lose power at small or moderate sample sizes. Given the current cost of sequencing technology, scales of NGS are still limited. In this report, we derive and implement computationally efficient, exact (nonasymptotic) score (eScore), likelihood ratio (eLRT), and restricted likelihood ratio (eRLRT) tests, ExactVCTest, that can achieve high power even when sample sizes are small. We perform simulation studies under various genetic scenarios. Our ExactVCTest (i.e., eScore, eLRT, eRLRT) exhibits well-controlled type I error. Under the alternative model, eScore P-values are universally smaller than those from SKAT. eLRT and eRLRT demonstrate significantly higher power than eScore, SKAT, and SKAT optimal (SKAT-o) across all scenarios and various samples sizes. We applied these tests to an exome sequencing study. Our findings replicate previous results and shed light on rare variant effects within genes. The software package is implemented in the open source, high-performance technical computing language Julia, and is freely available at https://github.com/Tao-Hu/VarianceComponentTest.jl. Analysis of each trait in the exome sequencing data set with 399 individuals and 16,619 genes takes around 1 min on a desktop computer.},

We show that an accurate variational transformation can be used to obtain a closed form approximation to the posterior distribution of the parameters thereby yielding an approximate posterior predictive model. This approach is readily extended to binary graphical model with complete observations. For graphical models with incomplete observations we utilize an additional variational transformation and again obtain a closed form approximation to the posterior. Finally, we show that the dual of the regression problem gives a latent variable density model, the variational formulation of which leads to exactly solvable EM updates.},

@article{BreslowClayton93GLMM,
	Abstract = {Statistical approaches to overdispersion, correlated errors, shrinkage estimation, and smoothing of regression relationships may be encompassed within the framework of the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). Given an unobserved vector of random effects, observations are assumed to be conditionally independent with means that depend on the linear predictor through a specified link function and conditional variances that are specified by a variance function, known prior weights and a scale factor. The random effects are assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and dispersion matrix depending on unknown variance components. For problems involving time series, spatial aggregation and smoothing, the dispersion may be specified in terms of a rank deficient inverse covariance matrix. Approximation of the marginal quasi-likelihood using Laplace's method leads eventually to estimating equations based on penalized quasilikelihood or PQL for the mean parameters and pseudo-likelihood for the variances. Implementation involves repeated calls to normal theory procedures for REML estimation in variance components problems. By means of informal mathematical arguments, simulations and a series of worked examples, we conclude that PQL is of practical value for approximate inference on parameters and realizations of random effects in the hierarchical model. The applications cover overdispersion in binomial proportions of seed germination; longitudinal analysis of attack rates in epilepsy patients; smoothing of birth cohort effects in an age-cohort model of breast cancer incidence; evaluation of curvature of birth cohort effects in a case-control study of childhood cancer and obstetric radiation; spatial aggregation of lip cancer rates in Scottish counties; and the success of salamander matings in a complicated experiment involving crossing of male and female effects. PQL tends to underestimate somewhat the variance components and (in absolute value) fixed effects when applied to clustered binary data, but the situation improves rapidly for binomial observations having denominators greater than one.},

	Abstract = {The DC programming and its DC algorithm (DCA) address the problem of minimizing a function f=g−h (with g,h being lower semicontinuous proper convex functions on R                  n                ) on the whole space. Based on local optimality conditions and DC duality, DCA was successfully applied to a lot of different and various nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization problems to which it quite often gave global solutions and proved to be more robust and more efficient than related standard methods, especially in the large scale setting. The computational efficiency of DCA suggests to us a deeper and more complete study on DC programming, using the special class of DC programs (when either g or h is polyhedral convex) called polyhedral DC programs. The DC duality is investigated in an easier way, which is more convenient to the study of optimality conditions. New practical results on local optimality are presented. We emphasize regularization techniques in DC programming in order to construct suitable equivalent DC programs to nondifferentiable nonconvex optimization problems and new significant questions which have to be answered. A deeper insight into DCA is introduced which really sheds new light on DCA and could partly explain its efficiency. Finally DC models of real world nonconvex optimization are reported.},

@article{FanHanLiu14BigDataChallenge,
	Abstract = {Big Data bring new opportunities to modern society and challenges to data scientists. On the one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This paper gives overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasize on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogenous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data cannot be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.},

@article{1000Genome10,
	Abstract = {{The 1000 Genomes Project aims to provide a deep characterization
	of human genome sequence variation as a foundation for investigating
	the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Here we present
	results of the pilot phase of the project, designed to develop and
	compare different strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput
	platforms. We undertook three projects: low-coverage whole-genome
	sequencing of 179 individuals from four populations; high-coverage
	sequencing of two mother-father-child trios; and exon-targeted sequencing
	of 697 individuals from seven populations. We describe the location,
	allele frequency and local haplotype structure of approximately 15
	million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1 million short insertions
	and deletions, and 20,000 structural variants, most of which were
	previously undescribed. We show that, because we have catalogued
	the vast majority of common variation, over 95\% of the currently
	accessible variants found in any individual are present in this data
	set. On average, each person is found to carry approximately 250
	to 300 loss-of-function variants in annotated genes and 50 to 100
	variants previously implicated in inherited disorders. We demonstrate
	how these results can be used to inform association and functional
	studies. From the two trios, we directly estimate the rate of de
	novo germline base substitution mutations to be approximately 10(-8)
	per base pair per generation. We explore the data with regard to
	signatures of natural selection, and identify a marked reduction
	of genetic variation in the neighbourhood of genes, due to selection
	at linked sites. These methods and public data will support the next
	phase of human genetic research.}},

	maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate
	minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE)
	which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is
	introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is
	defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the
	parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum
	likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within
	the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical
	model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent
	in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

@article{Arya03Framingham,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity and
	low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are strong cardiovascular
	risk factors, and that these traits are inversely correlated. Despite
	the belief that these traits are correlated in part due to pleiotropy,
	knowledge on specific genes commonly affecting obesity and dyslipidemia
	is very limited. To address this issue, we first conducted univariate
	multipoint linkage analysis for body mass index (BMI) and HDL-C to
	identify loci influencing variation in these phenotypes using Framingham
	Heart Study data relating to 1702 subjects distributed across 330
	pedigrees. Subsequently, we performed bivariate multipoint linkage
	analysis to detect common loci influencing covariation between these
	two traits.RESULTS:We scanned the genome and identified a major locus
	near marker D6S1009 influencing variation in BMI (LOD = 3.9) using
	the program SOLAR. We also identified a major locus for HDL-C near
	marker D2S1334 on chromosome 2 (LOD = 3.5) and another region near
	marker D6S1009 on chromosome 6 with suggestive evidence for linkage
	(LOD = 2.7). Since these two phenotypes have been independently mapped
	to the same region on chromosome 6q, we used the bivariate multipoint
	linkage approach using SOLAR. The bivariate linkage analysis of BMI
	and HDL-C implicated the genetic region near marker D6S1009 as harboring
	a major gene commonly influencing these phenotypes (bivariate LOD
	= 6.2; LODeq = 5.5) and appears to improve power to map the correlated
	traits to a region, precisely.CONCLUSIONS:We found substantial evidence
	for a quantitative trait locus with pleiotropic effects, which appears
	to influence both BMI and HDL-C phenotypes in the Framingham data.},

	Abstract = {For pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) association analysis,
	a range of methods utilizing within-family variation such as transmission-disequilibrium
	test (TDT)-based methods have been developed. In scenarios where
	stratification is not a concern, methods exploiting between-family
	variation in addition to within-family variation, such as the measured
	genotype (MG) approach, have greater power. Application of MG methods
	can be computationally demanding (especially for large pedigrees),
	making genomewide scans practically infeasible. Here we suggest a
	novel approach for genomewide pedigree-based quantitative trait loci
	(QTL) association analysis: genomewide rapid association using mixed
	model and regression (GRAMMAR). The method first obtains residuals
	adjusted for family effects and subsequently analyzes the association
	between these residuals and genetic polymorphisms using rapid least-squares
	methods. At the final step, the selected polymorphisms may be followed
	up with the full measured genotype (MG) analysis. In a simulation
	study, we compared type 1 error, power, and operational characteristics
	of the proposed method with those of MG and TDT-based approaches.
	For moderately heritable (30%) traits in human pedigrees the power
	of the GRAMMAR and the MG approaches is similar and is much higher
	than that of TDT-based approaches. When using tabulated thresholds,
	the proposed method is less powerful than MG for very high heritabilities
	and pedigrees including large sibships like those observed in livestock
	pedigrees. However, there is little or no difference in empirical
	power of MG and the proposed method. In any scenario, GRAMMAR is
	much faster than MG and enables rapid analysis of hundreds of thousands
	of markers.},

@article{Ayers2008,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Low haplotype diversity and linkage disequilibrium are
	the rule in short genomic segments. This fact suggests that parsimony
	should be enforced in estimation of haplotype frequencies. The current
	article introduces a diversity penalty that automatically discards
	potential haplotypes with low explanatory power. The standard EM
	algorithm for haplotype frequency estimation can accommodate the
	penalty if one passes over to a more general minorize--maximize (MM)
	scheme for estimation.Results: Our new MM algorithm converges in
	fewer iterations, eliminates marginal haplotypes from further consideration
	and reduces the computational complexity of each iteration. Estimation
	by the MM algorithm also improves haplotyping and genotype imputation
	compared to naive application of the EM algorithm. Thus, the MM algorithm
	is a useful substitute for the EM algorithm. Compared to the most
	sophisticated current methods of haplotyping and genotype imputation,
	the MM algorithm is slightly less accurate but at least an order
	of magnitude faster.Availability: Our software will be made available
	in the next release the program Mendel at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software/.Contact:

@article{Azzopardi2008ColorectalAdenoma,
	Abstract = {It has been proposed that multiple rare variants in numerous genes
	collectively account for a substantial proportion of multifactorial
	inherited predisposition to a variety of diseases, including colorectal
	adenomas (CRA). We have studied this hypothesis by sequencing the
	adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene in 691 unrelated North American
	patients with CRAs and 969 matched healthy controls. Rare inherited
	nonsynonymous variants of APC were significantly overrepresented
	in patients who did not carry conventional pathogenic mutations in
	the APC or MutY homologue genes [non-familial adenomatous polyposis
	(FAP) non-MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) patients; 81 of 480, 16.9%]
	compared with patients with FAP or MAP (20 of 211, 9.5%, P = 0.0113),
	and this overrepresentation was highest in those non-FAP non-MAP
	patients with 11 to 99 CRAs (30 of 161, 18.6%, P = 0.0103). Furthermore,
	significantly more non-FAP non-MAP patients carried rare nonsynonymous
	variants in the functionally important beta-catenin down-regulating
	domain compared with healthy controls (32 of 480 versus 37 of 969,
	P = 0.0166). In silico analyses predicted that approximately 46%
	of the 61 different variants identified were likely to affect function,
	and upon testing, 7 of 16 nonsynonymous variants were shown to alter
	beta-catenin-regulated transcription in vitro. These data suggest
	that multiple rare nonsynonymous variants in APC play a significant
	role in predisposing to CRAs.},

	algorithms for constrained and unconstrained optimization, Lagrange
	multipliers and duality, large scale problems, and the interface
	between continuous and discrete optimization. Among its special features,
	the book: 1) provides extensive coverage of iterative optimization
	methods within a unifying framework 2) provides a detailed treatment
	of interior point methods for linear programming 3) covers in depth
	duality theory from both a variational and a geometrical/convex analysis
	point of view 4) includes much new material on a number of topics,
	such as neural network training, discrete-time optimal control, and
	large-scale optimization 5) includes a large number of examples and
	exercises detailed solutions of many of which are posted on the internet
	Much supplementary/support material can be found at the book's web

@article{BoothHobert99GLMM-MCEM,
	Abstract = {{Two new implementations of the EM algorithm are proposed for maximum
	likelihood fitting of generalized linear mixed models. Both methods
	use random (independent and identically distributed) sampling to
	construct Monte Carlo approximations at the E-step. One approach
	involves generating random samples from the exact conditional distribution
	of the random effects (given the data) by rejection sampling, using
	the marginal distribution as a candidate. The second method uses
	a multivariate t importance sampling approximation. In many applications
	the two methods are complementary. Rejection sampling is more efficient
	when sample sizes are small, whereas importance sampling is better
	with larger sample sizes. Monte Carlo approximation using random
	samples allows the Monte Carlo error at each iteration to be assessed
	by using standard central limit theory combined with Taylor series
	methods. Specifically, we construct a sandwich variance estimate
	for the maximizer at each approximate E-step. This suggests a rule
	for automatically increasing the Monte Carlo sample size after iterations
	in which the true EM step is swamped by Monte Carlo error. In contrast,
	techniques for assessing Monte Carlo error have not been developed
	for use with alternative implementations of Monte Carlo EM algorithms
	utilizing Markov chain Monte Carlo E-step approximations. Three different
	data sets, including the infamous salamander data of McCullagh and
	Nelder, are used to illustrate the techniques and to compare them
	with the alternatives. The results show that the methods proposed
	can be considerably more efficient than those based on Markov chain
	Monte Carlo algorithms. However, the methods proposed may break down
	when the intractable integrals in the likelihood function are of
	high dimension.}},

@article{Breiman98Arcing,
	Abstract = {{Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of unstable
	classifiers such as trees or neural nets results in reduced test
	set error. One of the more effective is bagging. Here, modified training
	sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers
	constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting.
	Freund and Schapire propose an algorithm the basis of which is to
	adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym "arcing") so that
	the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most
	often misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting.
	Arcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction.
	We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and
	to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce
	the definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components
	of the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on
	a large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining

	Abstract = {{We present methods for imputing data for ungenotyped markers and
	for inferring haplotype phase in large data sets of unrelated individuals
	and parent-offspring trios. Our methods make use of known haplotype
	phase when it is available, and our methods are computationally efficient
	so that the full information in large reference panels with thousands
	of individuals is utilized. We demonstrate that substantial gains
	in imputation accuracy accrue with increasingly large reference panel
	sizes, particularly when imputing low-frequency variants, and that
	unphased reference panels can provide highly accurate genotype imputation.
	We place our methodology in a unified framework that enables the
	simultaneous use of unphased and phased data from trios and unrelated
	individuals in a single analysis. For unrelated individuals, our
	imputation methods produce well-calibrated posterior genotype probabilities
	and highly accurate allele-frequency estimates. For trios, our haplotype-inference
	method is four orders of magnitude faster than the gold-standard
	PHASE program and has excellent accuracy. Our methods enable genotype
	imputation to be performed with unphased trio or unrelated reference
	panels, thus accounting for haplotype-phase uncertainty in the reference
	panel. We present a useful measure of imputation accuracy, allelic
	R(2), and show that this measure can be estimated accurately from
	posterior genotype probabilities. Our methods are implemented in
	version 3.0 of the BEAGLE software package.}},

@article{Burge97GeneHMM,
	Abstract = {{We introduce a general probabilistic model of the gene structure
	of human genomic sequences which incorporates descriptions of the
	basic transcriptional, translational and splicing signals, as well
	as length distributions and compositional features of exons, introns
	and intergenic regions. Distinct sets of model parameters are derived
	to account for the many substantial differences in gene density and
	structure observed in distinct C + G compositional regions of the
	human genome. In addition, new models of the donor and acceptor splice
	signals are described which capture potentially important dependencies
	between signal positions. The model is applied to the problem of
	gene identification in a computer program, GENSCAN, which identifies
	complete exon/intron structures of genes in genomic DNA. Novel features
	of the program include the capacity to predict multiple genes in
	a sequence, to deal with partial as well as complete genes, and to
	predict consistent sets of genes occurring on either or both DNA
	strands. GENSCAN is shown to have substantially higher accuracy than
	existing methods when tested on standardized sets of human and vertebrate
	genes, with 75 to 80\% of exons identified exactly. The program is
	also capable of indicating fairly accurately the reliability of each
	predicted exon. Consistently high levels of accuracy are observed
	for sequences of differing C + G content and for distinct groups
	of vertebrates.}},

	and consequences of previous concepts. Intended for first-year graduate
	students, this book can be used for students majoring in statistics
	who have a solid mathematics background. It can also be used in a
	way that stresses the more practical uses of statistical theory,
	being more concerned with understanding basic statistical concepts
	and deriving reasonable statistical procedures for a variety of situations,
	and less concerned with formal optimality investigations.}},

@article{Chen91Trinomial,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a Dirichlet-trinomial distribution for modelling
	data obtained from reproductive and developmental studies. The common
	endpoints for the evaluation of reproductive and developmental toxic
	effects are the number of dead fetuses, the number of malformed fetuses,
	and the number of normal fetuses for each litter. With current statistical
	methods for the evaluation of reproductive and developmental effects,
	the effect on the number of deaths and the effect on the number of
	malformations are analyzed separately. The Dirichlet-trinomial model
	provides a procedure for the analysis of multiple endpoints simultaneously.
	This proposed Dirichlet-trinomial model is a generalization of the
	beta-binomial model that has been used for handling the litter effect
	in reproductive and developmental experiments. Likelihood ratio tests
	for differences in the number of deaths, the number of malformations,
	and the number of normals among dosed and control groups are derived.
	The proposed test procedure based on the Dirichlet-trinomial model
	is compared with that based on the beta-binomial model with an application
	to a real data set.},

	Abstract = {{Particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques are widely used in applied
	fields to solve challenging optimization problems but they do not
	seem to have made an impact in mainstream statistical applications
	hitherto. PSO methods are popular because they are easy to implement
	and use, and seem increasingly capable of solving complicated problems
	without requiring any assumption on the objective function to be
	optimized. We modify PSO techniques to find minimax optimal designs,
	which have been notoriously challenging to find to date even for
	linear models, and show that the PSO methods can readily generate
	a variety of minimax optimal designs in a novel and interesting way,
	including adapting the algorithm to generate standardized maximin
	optimal designs.}},

	intensive, taking days to impute one chromosome pair on 1000 people.
	We describe an efficient genotype imputation method based on matrix
	completion. Our matrix completion method is implemented in MATLAB
	and tested on real data from HapMap 3, simulated pedigree data, and
	simulated low-coverage sequencing data derived from the 1000 Genomes
	Project. Compared with leading imputation programs, the matrix completion
	algorithm embodied in our program MENDEL-IMPUTE achieves comparable
	imputation accuracy while reducing run times significantly. Implementation
	in a lower-level language such as Fortran or C is apt to further
	improve computational efficiency.},

	conferred by common DNA sequence polymorphisms. We tested whether
	rare DNA sequence variants collectively contribute to variation in
	plasma levels of highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). We
	sequenced three candidate genes (ABCA1, APOA1, and LCAT) that cause
	Mendelian forms of low HDL-C levels in individuals from a population-based
	study. Nonsynonymous sequence variants were significantly more common
	(16% versus 2%) in individuals with low HDL-C (<fifth percentile)
	than in those with high HDL-C (>95th percentile). Similar findings
	were obtained in an independent population, and biochemical studies
	indicated that most sequence variants in the low HDL-C group were
	functionally important. Thus, rare alleles with major phenotypic
	effects contribute significantly to low plasma HDL-C levels in the

@article{WellcomeTrust07,
	Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies
	represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved
	in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the
	Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British
	population, which has examined 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major
	diseases and a shared set of 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons
	identified 24 independent association signals at P<5 10-7: 1 in bipolar
	disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in
	rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes.
	On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed,
	almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects.
	We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found
	compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one
	of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large
	number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P
	values between 10-5 and 5 10-7) likely to yield additional susceptibility
	loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed
	by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This
	study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach.
	It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group
	represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple
	disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database
	for future studies of common diseases in the British population;
	and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are
	excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British
	population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for
	exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate
	that our data, results and software, which will be widely available
	to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human
	genetics research.},

	Abstract = { Let \&quot;X\&quot;<sub>1</sub>,\&hellip;,\&quot;X\&quot;<sub>\&quot;n\&quot;</sub>
	be independent and identically distributed random vectors with a
	(Lebesgue) density \&quot;f\&quot;. We first prove that, with probability
	1, there is a unique log-concave maximum likelihood estimator <formula
	format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file name=\&quot;rssb_753_mu1.gif\&quot;
	type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula> of \&quot;f\&quot;. The use of
	this estimator is attractive because, unlike kernel density estimation,
	the method is fully automatic, with no smoothing parameters to choose.
	Although the existence proof is non-constructive, we can reformulate
	the issue of computing <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file
	name=\&quot;rssb_753_mu2.gif\&quot; type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula>
	in terms of a non-differentiable convex optimization problem, and
	thus combine techniques of computational geometry with Shor's \&quot;r\&quot;-algorithm
	to produce a sequence that converges to <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file
	name=\&quot;rssb_753_mu3.gif\&quot; type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula>.
	An R version of the algorithm is available in the package LogConcDEAD-log-concave
	density estimation in arbitrary dimensions. We demonstrate that the
	estimator has attractive theoretical properties both when the true
	density is log-concave and when this model is misspecified. For the
	moderate or large sample sizes in our simulations, <formula format=\&quot;inline\&quot;><file
	name=\&quot;rssb_753_mu4.gif\&quot; type=\&quot;gif\&quot; /></formula>
	is shown to have smaller mean integrated squared error compared with
	kernel-based methods, even when we allow the use of a theoretical,
	optimal fixed bandwidth for the kernel estimator that would not be
	available in practice. We also present a real data clustering example,
	which shows that our methodology can be used in conjunction with
	the expectation-maximization algorithm to fit finite mixtures of
	log-concave densities. Copyright (c) 2010 Royal Statistical Society.},

	Abstract = {{Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis is traditionally based on individual
	genetic markers and often yields an erratic, non-monotonic picture,
	because the power to detect allelic associations depends on specific
	properties of each marker, such as frequency and population history.
	Ideally, LD analysis should be based directly on the underlying haplotype
	structure of the human genome, but this structure has remained poorly
	understood. Here we report a high-resolution analysis of the haplotype
	structure across 500 kilobases on chromosome 5q31 using 103 single-nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) in a European-derived population. The results
	show a picture of discrete haplotype blocks (of tens to hundreds
	of kilobases), each with limited diversity punctuated by apparent
	sites of recombination. In addition, we develop an analytical model
	for LD mapping based on such haplotype blocks. If our observed structure
	is general (and published data suggest that it may be), it offers
	a coherent framework for creating a haplotype map of the human genome.}},

@article{Davatzikos09Longitudinal,
	Abstract = {A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for
	early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers
	that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which
	have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient
	basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain
	atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive
	impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high
	accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle
	brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease
	stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain
	atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they
	are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's
	Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern
	classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which
	best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual
	person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal
	magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the
	Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study.
	The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present
	in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to
	cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively
	increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals
	with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated
	with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns
	of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic
	area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based
	spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease, evaluated
	with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may
	be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to
	be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective
	studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns
	and the emergence of clinical symptoms.},

	not require analytical calculation of the resampling probabilities.
	Our method can easily be used as part of a general algorithm for
	Monte Carlo calculation of bootstrap confidence intervals and hypothesis
	tests. It produces consistent, efficient and unbiased Monte Carlo
	approximations. We also present a very general but elementary account
	of importance resampling, which shows that even optimal importance
	resampling cannot improve on uniform resampling for calculating bootstrap
	estimates of bias, variance, skewness and related quantities. This
	result demonstrates a major difference between importance resampling
	and other approaches to efficient bootstrap simulation, such as balanced
	resampling and antithetic resampling, which produce significant improvements
	in efficiency for a wide range of problems involving the bootstrap.},

@article{Drikvandi13MultiVCTest,
	Abstract = {{Testing zero variance components is one of the most challenging problems
	in the context of linear mixed-effects (LME) models. The usual asymptotic
	chi-square distribution of the likelihood ratio and score statistics
	under this null hypothesis is incorrect because the null is on the
	boundary of the parameter space. During the last two decades many
	tests have been proposed to overcome this difficulty, but these tests
	cannot be easily applied for testing multiple variance components,
	especially for testing a subset of them. We instead introduce a simple
	test statistic based on the variance least square estimator of variance
	components. With this comes a permutation procedure to approximate
	its finite sample distribution. The proposed test covers testing
	multiple variance components and any subset of them in LME models.
	Interestingly, our method does not depend on the distribution of
	the random effects and errors except for their mean and variance.
	We show, via simulations, that the proposed test has good operating
	characteristics with respect to Type I error and power. We conclude
	with an application of our process using real data from a study of
	the association of hyperglycemia and relative hyperinsulinemia.}},

@article{Dutilleu99MatixNormalMLE,
	Abstract = {{The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the parameters of the
	matrix normal distribution is considered. In the absence of analytical
	solutions of the system of likelihood equations for the among-row
	and among-column covariance matrices, a two-stage algorithm must
	be solved to obtain their maximum likelihood estimators. A necessary
	and sufficient condition for the existence of maximum likelihood
	estimators is given and the question of their stability as solutions
	of the system of likelihood equations is addressed. In particular,
	the covariance matrix parameters and their maximum likelihood estimators
	are defined up to a positive multiplicative constant; only their
	direct product is uniquely defined. Using simulated data undertwovariance-covariancestructures
	that, otherwise, are indistinguishable by semivariance analysis,
	further specific aspects of the procedure are studied: (1) the convergence
	of the MLE algorithm is assessed; (2) the empirical bias of the direct
	product ofcovariance matrix estimators is calculated for various
	sample sizes; and (3) the consistency of the estimator is evaluated
	by its mean Euclidean distance from the parameter, as a function
	of the sample size. The adequacy of the matrix normal model, including
	the separability of the variance-covariance structure, is tested
	on multiple time series of dental medicine data; other applications
	to real doubly multivariate data are outlined.}},

@article{EastonEeles08CancerGWAS,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach
	to identify common, low-penetrance disease loci without prior knowledge
	of location or function. GWAS have been conducted in five of the
	commonest cancer types: breast, prostate, colorectal and lung, and
	melanoma, and have identified more than 20 novel disease loci, confirming
	that susceptibility to these diseases is polygenic. Many of these
	loci were detected at low power, indicating that many further loci
	will probably be detected with larger studies. For the most part,
	the loci were not previously suspected to be related to carcinogenesis,
	and point to new disease mechanisms. The risks conferred by the susceptibility
	alleles are low, generally 1.3-fold or less. The combined effects
	may, however, be sufficiently large to be useful for risk prediction,
	and targeted screening and prevention, particularly as more loci
	are identified. 10.1093/hmg/ddn287},

	Abstract = {{Generalized linear models are used for regression analysis in a number
	of cases, including categorical responses, where the classical assumptions
	are violated. The statistical analysis of such models is based on
	the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimator. We
	present mild general conditions which, respectively, assure weak
	or strong consistency or asymptotic normality. Most of the previous
	work has been concerned with natural link functions. In this case
	our normality condition, though obtained by a different approach,
	is closely related to a condition of Haberman (1977a). Examples show
	how the general conditions reduce to weak requirements for special
	exponential families. Further, for regressors with a compact range,
	sufficient conditions are given which do not involve the unknown
	parameter, and are therefore easy to check in practice. Responses
	with a bounded range, e.g. categorical responses, and stochastic
	regressors also are treated.}},

@article{FesslerHero94SAGE,
	Abstract = {{The expectation-maximization (EM) method can facilitate maximizing
	likelihood functions that arise in statistical estimation problems.
	In the classical EM paradigm, one iteratively maximizes the conditional
	log-likelihood of a single unobservable complete data space, rather
	than maximizing the intractable likelihood function for the measured
	or incomplete data. EM algorithms update all parameters simultaneously,
	which has two drawbacks: 1) slow convergence, and 2) difficult maximization
	steps due to coupling when smoothness penalties are used. The paper
	describes the space-alternating generalized EM (SAGE) method, which
	updates the parameters sequentially by alternating between several
	small hidden-data spaces defined by the algorithm designer. The authors
	prove that the sequence of estimates monotonically increases the
	penalized-likelihood objective, derive asymptotic convergence rates,
	and provide sufficient conditions for monotone convergence in norm.
	Two signal processing applications illustrate the method: estimation
	of superimposed signals in Gaussian noise, and image reconstruction
	from Poisson measurements. In both applications, the SAGE algorithms
	easily accommodate smoothness penalties and converge faster than
	the EM algorithms}},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:Obesity is related to multiple cardiovascular disease (CVD)
	risk factors as well as CVD and has a strong familial component.
	We tested for association between SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP
	GeneChip and measures of adiposity in the Framingham Heart Study.METHODS:A
	total of 1341 Framingham Heart Study participants in 310 families
	genotyped with the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip had adiposity traits
	measured over 30 years of follow up. Body mass index (BMI), waist
	circumference (WC), weight change, height, and radiographic measures
	of adiposity (subcutaneous adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue,
	waist circumference, sagittal height) were measured at multiple examination
	cycles. Multivariable-adjusted residuals, adjusting for age, age-squared,
	sex, smoking, and menopausal status, were evaluated in association
	with the genotype data using additive Generalized Estimating Equations
	(GEE) and Family Based Association Test (FBAT) models. We prioritized
	mean BMI over offspring examinations (1-7) and cohort examinations
	(10, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26) and mean WC over offspring examinations
	(4-7) for presentation. We evaluated associations with 70,987 SNPs
	on autosomes with minor allele frequencies of at least 0.10, Hardy-Weinberg
	equilibrium p [greater than or equal to] 0.001, and call rates of
	at least 80%.RESULTS:The top SNPs to be associated with mean BMI
	and mean WC by GEE were rs110683 (p-value 1.22*10-7) and rs4471028
	(p-values 1.96*10-7). Please see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?id=phs000007
	webcite for the complete set of results. We were able to validate
	SNPs in known genes that have been related to BMI or other adiposity
	traits, including the ESR1 Xba1 SNP, PPARG, and ADIPOQ.CONCLUSION:Adiposity
	traits are associated with SNPs on the Affymetrix 100K SNP GeneChip.
	Replication of these initial findings is necessary. These data will
	serve as a resource for replication as more genes become identified
	with BMI and WC.},

	Abstract = {{Chemometrics is a field of chemistry that studies the application
	of statistical methods to chemical data analysis. In addition to
	borrowing many techniques from the statistics and engineering literatures,
	chemometrics itself has given rise to several new data-analytical
	methods. This article examines two methods commonly used in chemometrics
	for predictive modeling-partial least squares and principal components
	regression-from a statistical perspective. The goal is to try to
	understand their apparent successes and in what situations they can
	be expected to work well and to compare them with other statistical
	methods intended for those situations. These methods include ordinary
	least squares, variable subset selection, and ridge regression.}},

	Abstract = {The last few years have seen extensive efforts to catalogue human
	genetic variation and correlate it with phenotypic differences. Most
	common SNPs have now been assessed in genome-wide studies for statistical
	associations with many complex traits, including many important common
	diseases. Although these studies have provided new biological insights,
	only a limited amount of the heritable component of any complex trait
	has been identified and it remains a challenge to elucidate the functional
	link between associated variants and phenotypic traits. Technological
	advances, such as the ability to detect rare and structural variants,
	and a clear understanding of the challenges in linking different
	types of variation with phenotype, will be essential for future progress.},

	Abstract = {The importance of the SWEEP operator in statistical computing is not
	so much that it is an inversion technique, but rather that it is
	a conceptual tool for understanding the least squares process. The
	SWEEP operator can be programmed to produce generalized inverses
	and create, as by-products, such items as the Forward Doolittle matrix,
	the Cholesky decomposition matrix, the Hermite canonical form matrix,
	the determinant of the original matrix, Type I sums of squares, the
	error sum of squares, a solution to the normal equations, and the
	general form of estimable functions. First, this tutorial describes
	the use of Gauss-Jordan elimination for least squares and continues
	with a description of a completely generalized sweep operator that
	computes and stores (X'X)-, (X'X)-X'X, (X'X)-X'Y, and Y'Y - Y'X(X'X)-X'Y,
	all in the space of a single upper triangular matrix.},

@article{Griffiths73BetaBinMLE,
	Abstract = {In part I, maximum likelihood (ML) estimation for the beta-binomial
	distribution (BBD) is considered. The BBD can be used as a model
	for the incidence in households of noninfectious disease. Typically
	households in which there are no cases of disease will not be included
	in the data. It is then necessary to fit a truncated BBD. Alternative
	modes of infection are discussed in part II. These give rise to a
	variety of models for the household distribution of the number of
	cases of a disease. The BBD is fitted to some data on the common
	cold and influenza. Other models have been fitted by previous authors
	to the same data. Independent epidemiological evidence would be necessary
	for choosing among these models.},

	Abstract = {Toxicologists frequently conduct toxicity experiments in which different
	treatment conditions are applied to groups of animals and the resulting
	mortality in each group is measured at a number of discrete time
	points over the course of the experiment. Both survival analysis
	and generalized linear models have been proposed for analyzing this
	type of data. Whatever the approach taken, the model should allow
	for the presence of extra-multinomial variation arising from the
	use of groups of animals rather than individuals as the experimental
	units. We consider a number of models for overdispersion that can
	be incorporated into the generalized linear model framework for multinomial
	data. These models are extensions of ones proposed for binomial data
	by Williams (1982, Applied Statistics 31, 144-148) and Moore (1986,
	Biometrika 73, 583-588; 1987, Applied Statistics 36, 8-14). In addition,
	we examine robust asymptotic covariance matrix estimators for regression
	parameters, similar to those given in Liang and Zeger (1986, Biometrika
	73, 13-22) and Zeger and Liang (1986, Biometrics 42, 121-130), and
	compare them to the model-based asymptotic estimators. Recommendations
	for analysis are given.},

@article{Hodges07Exom,
	Abstract = {Increasingly powerful sequencing technologies are ushering in an era
	of personal genome sequences and raising the possibility of using
	such information to guide medical decisions. Genome resequencing
	also promises to accelerate the identification of disease-associated
	mutations. Roughly 98\% of the human genome is composed of repeats
	and intergenic or nonprotein-coding sequences. Thus, it is crucial
	to focus resequencing on high-value genomic regions. Protein-coding
	exons represent one such type of high-value target. We have developed
	a method of using flexible, high-density microarrays to capture any
	desired fraction of the human genome, in this case corresponding
	to more than 200,000 protein-coding exons. Depending on the precise
	protocol, up to 5585\% of the captured fragments are associated
	with targeted regions and up to 98\% of intended exons can be recovered.
	This methodology provides an adaptable route toward rapid and efficient
	resequencing of any sizeable, non-repeat portion of the human genome.},

@article{HowieDonnellyMarchini09Impute,
	Abstract = {{Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis
	of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date
	have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels
	(such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed
	samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader
	range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing
	power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2)
	that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new
	datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling
	framework that increases accuracy and combines information across
	multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible.
	We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods
	when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size
	of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also
	find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding
	the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that
	IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare
	and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%--20\% lower
	than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging
	aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information
	across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs;
	we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages
	over other suggested solutions. Large association studies have proven
	to be effective tools for identifying parts of the genome that influence
	disease risk and other heritable traits. So-called '' genotype imputation''
	methods form a cornerstone of modern association studies: by extrapolating
	genetic correlations from a densely characterized reference panel
	to a sparsely typed study sample, such methods can estimate unobserved
	genotypes with high accuracy, thereby increasing the chances of finding
	true associations. To date, most genome-wide imputation analyses
	have used reference data from the International HapMap Project. While
	this strategy has been successful, association studies in the near
	future will also have access to additional reference information,
	such as control sets genotyped on multiple SNP chips and dense genome-wide
	haplotypes from the 1,000 Genomes Project. These new reference panels
	should improve the quality and scope of imputation, but they also
	present new methodological challenges. We describe a genotype imputation
	method, IMPUTE version 2, that is designed to address these challenges
	in next-generation association studies. We show that our method can
	use a reference panel containing thousands of chromosomes to attain
	higher accuracy than is possible with the HapMap alone, and that
	our approach is more accurate than competing methods on both current
	and next-generation datasets. We also highlight the modeling issues
	that arise in imputation datasets.}},

@book{Hubbell01,
	Abstract = {{<p>Despite its supreme importance and the threat of its global crash,
	biodiversity remains poorly understood both empirically and theoretically.
	This ambitious book presents a new, general neutral theory to explain
	the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity in a biogeographic
	context.</p><p> Until now biogeography (the study of the geographic
	distribution of species) and biodiversity (the study of species richness
	and relative species abundance) have had largely disjunct intellectual
	histories. In this book, Stephen Hubbell develops a formal mathematical
	theory that unifies these two fields. When a speciation process is
	incorporated into Robert H. MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson's now
	classical theory of island biogeography, the generalized theory predicts
	the existence of a universal, dimensionless biodiversity number.
	In the theory, this fundamental biodiversity number, together with
	the migration or dispersal rate, completely determines the steady-state
	distribution of species richness and relative species abundance on
	local to large geographic spatial scales and short-term to evolutionary
	time scales. </p><p> Although neutral, Hubbell's theory is nevertheless
	able to generate many nonobvious, testable, and remarkably accurate
	quantitative predictions about biodiversity and biogeography. In
	many ways Hubbell's theory is the ecological analog to the neutral
	theory of genetic drift in genetics. The unified neutral theory of
	biogeography and biodiversity should stimulate research in new theoretical
	and empirical directions by ecologists, evolutionary biologists,
	and biogeographers.</p>}},

@article{HungWang12MVLogistic,
	Abstract = {Logistic regression has been widely applied in the field of biomedical
	research for a long time. In some applications, the covariates of
	interest have a natural structure, such as that of a matrix, at the
	time of collection. The rows and columns of the covariate matrix
	then have certain physical meanings, and they must contain useful
	information regarding the response. If we simply stack the covariate
	matrix as a vector and fit a conventional logistic regression model,
	relevant information can be lost, and the problem of inefficiency
	will arise. Motivated from these reasons, we propose in this paper
	the matrix variate logistic (MV-logistic) regression model. The advantages
	of the MV-logistic regression model include the preservation of the
	inherent matrix structure of covariates and the parsimony of parameters
	needed. In the EEG Database Data Set, we successfully extract the
	structural effects of covariate matrix, and a high classification
	accuracy is achieved.},

@article{IonitaLaird11NewTest,
	Abstract = {{Rapid advances in sequencing technologies set the stage for the large-scale
	medical sequencing efforts to be performed in the near future, with
	the goal of assessing the importance of rare variants in complex
	diseases. The discovery of new disease susceptibility genes requires
	powerful statistical methods for rare variant analysis. The low frequency
	and the expected large number of such variants pose great difficulties
	for the analysis of these data. We propose here a robust and powerful
	testing strategy to study the role rare variants may play in affecting
	susceptibility to complex traits. The strategy is based on assessing
	whether rare variants in a genetic region collectively occur at significantly
	higher frequencies in cases compared with controls (or vice versa).
	A main feature of the proposed methodology is that, although it is
	an overall test assessing a possibly large number of rare variants
	simultaneously, the disease variants can be both protective and risk
	variants, with moderate decreases in statistical power when both
	types of variants are present. Using simulations, we show that this
	approach can be powerful under complex and general disease models,
	as well as in larger genetic regions where the proportion of disease
	susceptibility variants may be small. Comparisons with previously
	published tests on simulated data show that the proposed approach
	can have better power than the existing methods. An application to
	a recently published study on Type-1 Diabetes finds rare variants
	in gene IFIH1 to be protective against Type-1 Diabetes.}},

	Abstract = {The recent emergence of massively parallel sequencing technologies
	has enabled an increasing number of human genome re-sequencing studies,
	notable among them being the 1000 Genomes Project. The main aim of
	these studies is to identify the yet unknown genetic variants in
	a genomic region, mostly low frequency variants (frequency less than
	5%). We propose here a set of statistical tools that address how
	to optimally design such studies in order to increase the number
	of genetic variants we expect to discover. Within this framework,
	the tradeoff between lower coverage for more individuals and higher
	coverage for fewer individuals can be naturally solved. The methods
	here are also useful for estimating the number of genetic variants
	missed in a discovery study performed at low coverage. We show applications
	to simulated data based on coalescent models and to sequence data
	from the ENCODE project. In particular, we show the extent to which
	combining data from multiple populations in a discovery study may
	increase the number of genetic variants identified relative to studies

	Abstract = {{This introductory text offers a clear exposition of the algorithmic
	principles driving advances in bioinformatics. Accessible to students
	in both biology and computer science, it strikes a unique balance
	between rigorous mathematics and practical techniques, emphasizing
	the ideas underlying algorithms rather than offering a collection
	of apparently unrelated problems.<br /> <br /> The book introduces
	biological and algorithmic ideas together, linking issues in computer
	science to biology and thus capturing the interest of students in
	both subjects. It demonstrates that relatively few design techniques
	can be used to solve a large number of practical problems in biology,
	and presents this material intuitively.<br /> <br /> <i>An Introduction
	to Bioinformatics Algorithms</i> is one of the first books on bioinformatics
	that can be used by students at an undergraduate level. It includes
	a dual table of contents, organized by algorithmic idea and biological
	idea; discussions of biologically relevant problems, including a
	detailed problem formulation and one or more solutions for each;
	and brief biographical sketches of leading figures in the field.
	These interesting vignettes offer students a glimpse of the inspirations
	and motivations for real work in bioinformatics, making the concepts
	presented in the text more concrete and the techniques more approachable.<br
	/> <br /> PowerPoint presentations, practical bioinformatics problems,
	sample code, diagrams, demonstrations, and other materials can be
	found at the Author's website.}},

@article{Kang2008,
	Abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse
	strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors
	related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in
	inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population
	structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates,
	which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human
	association studies such as genomic control or structured association.
	Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct
	for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis
	panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods
	suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose
	a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects
	for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism
	association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature
	of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association
	mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational
	speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico
	whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving
	hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize
	data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate
	the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying
	degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple
	measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse
	association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred
	strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which
	fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies
	while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation
	and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

@article{KimSohnXing09GFuse,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Many complex disease syndromes such as asthma consist
	of a large number of highly related, rather than independent, clinical
	phenotypes, raising a new technical challenge in identifying genetic
	variations associated simultaneously with correlated traits. Although
	a causal genetic variation may influence a group of highly correlated
	traits jointly, most of the previous association analyses considered
	each phenotype separately, or combined results from a set of single-phenotype
	analyses.Results: We propose a new statistical framework called graph-guided
	fused lasso to address this issue in a principled way. Our approach
	represents the dependency structure among the quantitative traits
	explicitly as a network, and leverages this trait network to encode
	structured regularizations in a multivariate regression model over
	the genotypes and traits, so that the genetic markers that jointly
	influence subgroups of highly correlated traits can be detected with
	high sensitivity and specificity. While most of the traditional methods
	examined each phenotype independently, our approach analyzes all
	of the traits jointly in a single statistical method to discover
	the genetic markers that perturb a subset of correlated triats jointly
	rather than a single trait. Using simulated datasets based on the
	HapMap consortium data and an asthma dataset, we compare the performance
	of our method with the single-marker analysis, and other sparse regression
	methods that do not use any structural information in the traits.

	It is presented as an extension of a single-trait method for use
	with three-generation, outbred pedigrees. The multiple-trait framework
	allows formal testing of whether the same QTL affects more than one
	trait (i.e., a pleiotropic QTL) or whether more than one linked QTL
	are segregating. Several approaches to the testing procedure are
	presented and their suitability discussed. The performance of the
	method is investigated by simulation. As previously found, multitrait
	analyses increase the power to detect a pleiotropic QTL and the precision
	of its location estimate. With enough information, discrimination
	between alternative genetic models is possible.},

	does not avoid difficult topics. His intent is to demonstrate to
	the reader how to successfully operate within the profession. He
	outlines how to write grant proposals that are persuasive and compelling,
	how to write a letter of recommendation describing the research abilities
	of a candidate for promotion or tenure, and what a dean is looking
	for in a letter of recommendation. He further addresses some basic
	issues such as writing a book proposal to a publisher or applying

@article{KumarHenikoffNg09SIFT,
	Abstract = {The effect of genetic mutation on phenotype is of significant interest
	in genetics. The type of genetic mutation that causes a single amino
	acid substitution (AAS) in a protein sequence is called a non-synonymous
	single nucleotide polymorphism (nsSNP). An nsSNP could potentially
	affect the function of the protein, subsequently altering the carrier's
	phenotype. This protocol describes the use of the 'Sorting Tolerant
	From Intolerant' (SIFT) algorithm in predicting whether an AAS affects
	protein function. To assess the effect of a substitution, SIFT assumes
	that important positions in a protein sequence have been conserved
	throughout evolution and therefore substitutions at these positions
	may affect protein function. Thus, by using sequence homology, SIFT
	predicts the effects of all possible substitutions at each position
	in the protein sequence. The protocol typically takes 520 min, depending
	on the input. SIFT is available as an online tool (http://sift.jcvi.org).},

@article{Kwee08Kernel,
	Abstract = {{Association mapping of complex traits typically employs tagSNP genotype
	data to identify a trait locus within a region of interest. However,
	considerable debate exists regarding the most powerful strategy for
	utilizing such tagSNP data for inference. A popular approach tests
	each tagSNP within the region individually, but such tests could
	lose power as a result of incomplete linkage disequilibrium between
	the genotyped tagSNP and the trait locus. Alternatively, one can
	jointly test all tagSNPs simultaneously within the region (by using
	genotypes or haplotypes), but such multivariate tests have large
	degrees of freedom that can also compromise power. Here, we consider
	a semiparametric model for quantitative-trait mapping that uses genetic
	information from multiple tagSNPs simultaneously in analysis but
	produces a test statistic with reduced degrees of freedom compared
	to existing multivariate approaches. We fit this model by using a
	dimension-reducing technique called least-squares kernel machines,
	which we show is identical to analysis using a specific linear mixed
	model (which we can fit by using standard software packages like
	SAS and R). Using simulated SNP data based on real data from the
	International HapMap Project, we demonstrate that our approach often
	has superior performance for association mapping of quantitative
	traits compared to the popular approach of single-tagSNP testing.
	Our approach is also flexible, because it allows easy modeling of
	covariates and, if interest exists, high-dimensional interactions
	among tagSNPs and environmental predictors.}},

	Abstract = {{Mendelian likelihoods are computed from human pedigree data for purposes
	of gene mapping, risk prediction in genetic counseling, and hypothesis
	testing in genetic epidemiology. The Mendelian likelihood of an extended
	pedigree can be written as a sum of products, the sum ranging over
	all possible genotypic combinations for the individuals in the pedigree.
	Exclusion of genotypes incompatible with the phenotypic information
	and pedigree structure reduces the ranges of summation and simplifies
	the likelihood calculation. To evaluate the likelihood with the fewest
	possible arithmetic operations requires carrying out the summations
	over one individual at a time and the intervening multiplications
	in some appropriate order. Each such removal of an individual reduces
	the likelihood evaluation to another evaluation of the same numerical
	form. Greedy-type algorithms are suggested for determining an order
	in which the summations and multiplications may be carried out. The
	greedy methods are fast and appear to generate good removal sequences.
	They are shown to work well when applied to a large, complex pedigree.}},

@article{LangoAllen10Height,
	Abstract = {{ Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of
	inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence
	the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified
	more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically
	explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions
	about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals,
	we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci,
	influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic
	trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications
	for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the
	180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that
	are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie
	skeletal growth defects (P?<?0.001). Second, the likely causal gene
	is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13
	of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was
	closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple
	independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity
	is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations
	of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and
	that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified.
	Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects
	on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid
	structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our
	data explain approximately 10\% of the phenotypic variation in height,
	and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect
	sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16\% of phenotypic
	variation (approximately 20\% of heritable variation). Although additional
	approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic
	human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify
	large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes
	and pathways. }},

	finding good approximative solutions to hard combinatorial optimization
	problems. The chapter begins with a general presentation of several
	methods for constructing hierarchies of linear and/or semidefinite
	relaxations for 0/1 problems. Then it moves to an in-depth study
	of two prominent combinatorial optimization problems: the maximum
	stable set problem and the max-cut problem. Details are given about
	the approximation of the stability number by the Lov{\'a}sz theta number
	and about the Goemans-Williamson approximation algorithm for max-cut,
	two results for which semidefinite programming plays an essential
	role, and we survey some extensions of these approximation results

@article{LeeSeung99NNMF,
	Abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There
	is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations
	in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition
	rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains
	or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate
	an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to
	learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast
	to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector
	quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations.
	Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other
	methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints
	lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive,
	not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization
	is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge
	by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never
	negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

	genetic variants, gene and protein expression, and epigenetic modifications.
	One often overlooked complication with such studies is batch effects,
	which occur because measurements are affected by laboratory conditions,
	reagent lots and personnel differences. This becomes a major problem
	when batch effects are correlated with an outcome of interest and
	lead to incorrect conclusions. Using both published studies and our
	own analyses, we argue that batch effects (as well as other technical
	and biological artefacts) are widespread and critical to address.
	We review experimental and computational approaches for doing so.},

@article{LeekStorey07Surrogate,
	Abstract = {It has unambiguously been shown that genetic, environmental, demographic,
	and technical factors may have substantial effects on gene expression
	levels. In addition to the measured variable(s) of interest, there
	will tend to be sources of signal due to factors that are unknown,
	unmeasured, or too complicated to capture through simple models.
	We show that failing to incorporate these sources of heterogeneity
	into an analysis can have widespread and detrimental effects on the
	study. Not only can this reduce power or induce unwanted dependence
	across genes, but it can also introduce sources of spurious signal
	to many genes. This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized
	studies. We introduce surrogate variable analysis (SVA) to overcome
	the problems caused by heterogeneity in expression studies. SVA can
	be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately
	capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables
	of interest. We apply SVA to disease class, time course, and genetics
	of gene expression studies. We show that SVA increases the biological
	accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression
	studies.},

@article{LettreRioux08AutoimmuneGWAS,
	Abstract = {Autoimmune diseases occur when an individual's own immune system attacks
	and destroys his or her healthy cells and tissues. Although it is
	clear that environmental stimuli can predispose someone to develop
	autoimmune diseases, twin- and family-based studies have shown that
	genetic factors also play an important role in modifying disease
	risk. Because many of these diseases are relatively common (prevalence
	in European-derived populations: 0.01-1\%) and exhibit a complex
	mode of inheritance, many DNA sequence variants with modest effect
	on disease risk contribute to the genetic burden. Recently, the completion
	of the HapMap project, together with the development of new genotyping
	technologies, has given human geneticists the tools necessary to
	comprehensively, and in an unbiased manner, search our genome for
	DNA polymorphisms associated with many autoimmune diseases. Here
	we review recent progress made in the identification of genetic risk
	factors for celiac disease, Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis,
	rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and type-1 diabetes
	using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Strikingly, GWAS have
	increased the number of genetic risk variants associated with these
	autoimmune diseases from 15 before 2006 to 68 now. We summarize what
	this new genetic landscape teaches us in terms of the pathogenesis
	of these diseases, and highlight some of the outstanding challenges
	ahead. Finally, we open a discussion on ways to best maximize the
	impact of these genetic discoveries where it matters the most, that
	is for autoimmune disease patients. 10.1093/hmg/ddn246},

@article{LiLeal08RareVariants,
	Abstract = {Although whole-genome association studies using tagSNPs are a powerful
	approach for detecting common variants, they are underpowered for
	detecting associations with rare variants. Recent studies have demonstrated
	that common diseases can be due to functional variants with a wide
	spectrum of allele frequencies, ranging from rare to common. An effective
	way to identify rare variants is through direct sequencing. The development
	of cost-effective sequencing technologies enables association studies
	to use sequence data from candidate genes and, in the future, from
	the entire genome. Although methods used for analysis of common variants
	are applicable to sequence data, their performance might not be optimal.
	In this study, it is shown that the collapsing method, which involves
	collapsing genotypes across variants and applying a univariate test,
	is powerful for analyzing rare variants, whereas multivariate analysis
	is robust against inclusion of noncausal variants. Both methods are
	superior to analyzing each variant individually with univariate tests.
	In order to unify the advantages of both collapsing and multiple-marker
	tests, we developed the Combined Multivariate and Collapsing (CMC)
	method and demonstrated that the CMC method is both powerful and
	robust. The CMC method can be applied to either candidate-gene or
	whole-genome sequence data.},

@article{LiLi08GraphReg,
	Abstract = {Motivation: Graphs or networks are common ways of depicting information.
	In biology in particular, many different biological processes are
	represented by graphs, such as regulatory networks or metabolic pathways.
	This kind of a priori information gathered over many years of biomedical
	research is a useful supplement to the standard numerical genomic
	data such as microarray gene-expression data. How to incorporate
	information encoded by the known biological networks or graphs into
	analysis of numerical data raises interesting statistical challenges.
	In this article, we introduce a network-constrained regularization
	procedure for linear regression analysis in order to incorporate
	the information from these graphs into an analysis of the numerical
	data, where the network is represented as a graph and its corresponding
	Laplacian matrix. We define a network-constrained penalty function
	that penalizes the L1-norm of the coefficients but encourages smoothness
	of the coefficients on the network.Results: Simulation studies indicated
	that the method is quite effective in identifying genes and subnetworks
	that are related to disease and has higher sensitivity than the commonly
	used procedures that do not use the pathway structure information.
	Application to one glioblastoma microarray gene-expression dataset
	identified several subnetworks on several of the Kyoto Encyclopedia
	of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) transcriptional pathways that are related
	to survival from glioblastoma, many of which were supported by published
	literatures.Conclusions: The proposed network-constrained regularization
	procedure efficiently utilizes the known pathway structures in identifying
	the relevant genes and the subnetworks that might be related to phenotype
	in a general regression framework. As more biological networks are
	identified and documented in databases, the proposed method should
	find more applications in identifying the subnetworks that are related
	to diseases and other biological processes.Contact: hongzhe@mail.med.upenn.edu},

	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>It has been demonstrated that both
	rare and common variants are involved in complex disease etiology.
	Until recently it was only possible to perform large scale analysis
	of common variants. With the development of next-generation sequencing
	technologies, detection and mapping of rare variants have been made
	possible. However, methods used to analyze common variants are not
	powerful for the analysis of rare variants. To address the problems
	of rare variant analysis working in a novel framework, the kernel-based
	adaptive cluster (KBAC) method was developed to perform gene/locus
	based analysis. The KBAC combines variant classification and association
	testing in a coherent framework. Through simulations motivated by
	population genetic and disease data, it is demonstrated that the
	KBAC has superior power to other rare variant analysis methods, especially
	in the presence of variant misclassification and gene interaction.
	Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, the KBAC method was applied
	to test for associations between energy metabolism traits and rare
	variants in <italic>ANGPTL</italic> 3,4,5 and 6 genes. A number of
	novel associations were identified. The KBAC method is implemented
	in a user-friendly R package.</p>},

@article{LuanLi07GAR,
	Abstract = {{One important problem in genomic research is to identify genomic
	features such as gene expression data or DNA single nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs) that are related to clinical phenotypes. Often these genomic
	data can be naturally divided into biologically meaningful groups
	such as genes belonging to the same pathways or SNPs within genes.
	In this paper, we propose group additive regression models and a
	group gradient descent boosting procedure for identifying groups
	of genomic features that are related to clinical phenotypes. Our
	simulation results show that by dividing the variables into appropriate
	groups, we can obtain better identification of the group features
	that are related to the phenotypes. In addition, the prediction mean
	square errors are also smaller than the component-wise boosting procedure.
	We demonstrate the application of the methods to pathway-based analysis
	of microarray gene expression data of breast cancer. Results from
	analysis of a breast cancer microarray gene expression data set indicate
	that the pathways of metalloendopeptidases (MMPs) and MMP inhibitors,
	as well as cell proliferation, cell growth, and maintenance are important
	to breast cancer-specific survival.}},

	Abstract = {{Motivation: Development of high-throughput technology makes it possible
	to measure expressions of thousands of genes simultaneously. Genes
	have the inherent pathway structure, where pathways are composed
	of multiple genes with coordinated biological functions. It is of
	great interest to identify differential gene pathways that are associated
	with the variations of phenotypes.Results: We propose the following
	approach for detecting differential gene pathways. First, we construct
	gene pathways using databases such as KEGG or GO. Second, for each
	pathway, we extract a small number of representative features, which
	are linear combinations of gene expressions and/or their transformations.
	Specifically, we propose using (i) principal components (PCs) of
	gene expression sets, (ii) PCs of expanded gene expression sets and
	(iii) expanded sets of PCs of gene expressions, as the representative
	features. Third, we identify differential gene pathways as those
	with representative features significantly associated with the variations
	of phenotypes, particularly disease clinical outcomes, in regression
	models. The false discovery rate approach is used to adjust for multiple
	comparisons. Analysis of three gene expression datasets suggests
	that (i) the proposed approach can effectively identify differential
	gene pathways; (ii) PCs that explain only a small amount of variations
	of gene expressions may bear significant associations between gene
	pathways and phenotypes; (iii) including second-order terms of gene
	expressions may lead to identification of new differential gene pathways;
	(iv) the proposed approach is relatively insensitive to additional
	noises; and (v) the proposed approach can identify gene pathways
	missed by alternative approaches.Contact: shuangge.ma@yale.eduSupplementary

@article{ManginThoquetGrimsley98MTraits,
	Abstract = {Statistical methods for the detection of genes influencing quantitative
	trait (QTLs) with the aid of genetic markers are well developed for
	the analysis of a single trait. In practice, many experimental data
	contain observations on multiple correlated traits and methods that
	permit joint analysis of all traits are now required. Generalisation
	of the maximum likelihood method to a multitrait analysis is a good
	approach, but the increase in complexity, due to the number of parameters
	to be estimated simultaneously, could restrain its practical use
	when the number of traits is large. We propose an alternative method
	based on two separate steps. The first step is to estimate the (co)variance
	matrix of the traits and use this estimate to obtain the canonical
	variables associated to the traits. The second step is to apply a
	single-trait maximum likelihood method to each of the canonical variables
	and to combine the results. Working in a local asymptotic framework
	for the effects of the putative pleiotropic QTL, i.e., for a pleiotropic
	QTL whose effect is too small to be detected with certainty, we prove
	that the combined analysis with canonical variables is asymptotically
	equivalent to a multitrait maximum likehood analysis. A threshold
	for the mapping of the pleiotropic QTL is also given. The probability
	of detecting a QTL is not always increased by the addition of more
	correlated traits. As an example, a theoretical comparison between
	the power of a multitrait analysis with two variables and the power
	of a single-trait analysis is presented. Experimental data collected
	to study the polygenic resistance of tomato plants to bacterial wilt
	are used to illustrate the combined analysis with canonical variables.},

@article{MengRubin91SEM,
	Abstract = {The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a popular, and often
	remarkably simple, method for maximum likelihood estimation in incomplete-data
	problems. One criticism of EM in practice is that asymptotic variance-covariance
	matrices for parameters (e.g., standard errors) are not automatic
	byproducts, as they are when using some other methods, such as Newton-Raphson.
	In this article we define and illustrate a procedure that obtains
	numerically stable asymptotic variance-covariance matrices using
	only the code for computing the complete-data variance-covariance
	matrix, the code for EM itself, and code for standard matrix operations.
	The basic idea is to use the fact that the rate of convergence of
	EM is governed by the fractions of missing information to find the
	increased variability due to missing information to add to the complete-data
	variance-covariance matrix. We call this supplemented EM algorithm
	the SEM algorithm. Theory and particular examples reinforce the conclusion
	that the SEM algorithm can be a practically important supplement
	to EM in many problems. SEM is especially useful in multiparameter
	problems where only a subset of the parameters are affected by missing
	information and in parallel computing environments. SEM can also
	be used as a tool for monitoring whether EM has converged to a (local)
	maximum.},

@article{Misra09LongtitudinalPrediction,
	Abstract = {High-dimensional pattern classification was applied to baseline and
	multiple follow-up \{MRI\} scans of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
	Initiative (ADNI) participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
	in order to investigate the potential of predicting short-term conversion
	to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) on an individual basis. \{MCI\} participants
	that converted to \{AD\} (average follow-up 15 months) displayed
	significantly lower volumes in a number of grey matter (GM) regions,
	as well as in the white matter (WM). They also displayed more pronounced
	periventricular small-vessel pathology, as well as an increased rate
	of increase of such pathology. Individual person analysis was performed
	using a pattern classifier previously constructed from \{AD\} patients
	and cognitively normal (CN) individuals to yield an abnormality score
	that is positive for AD-like brains and negative otherwise. The abnormality
	scores measured from \{MCI\} non-converters (MCI-NC) followed a bimodal
	distribution, reflecting the heterogeneity of this group, whereas
	they were positive in almost all \{MCI\} converters (MCI-C), indicating
	extensive patterns of AD-like brain atrophy in almost all MCI-C.
	Both \{MCI\} subgroups had similar \{MMSE\} scores at baseline. A
	more specialized classifier constructed to differentiate converters
	from non-converters based on their baseline scans provided good classification
	accuracy reaching 81.5%, evaluated via cross-validation. These pattern
	classification schemes, which distill spatial patterns of atrophy
	to a single abnormality score, offer promise as biomarkers of \{AD\}
	and as predictors of subsequent clinical progression, on an individual
	patient basis. },

@article{Montgomery10Transcriptome,
	Abstract = {Gene expression is an important phenotype that informs about genetic
	and environmental effects on cellular state. Many studies have previously
	identified genetic variants for gene expression phenotypes using
	custom and commercially available microarrays. Second generation
	sequencing technologies are now providing unprecedented access to
	the fine structure of the transcriptome. We have sequenced the mRNA
	fraction of the transcriptome in 60 extended HapMap individuals of
	European descent and have combined these data with genetic variants
	from the HapMap3 project. We have quantified exon abundance based
	on read depth and have also developed methods to quantify whole transcript
	abundance. We have found that approximately 10 million reads of sequencing
	can provide access to the same dynamic range as arrays with better
	quantification of alternative and highly abundant transcripts. Correlation
	with SNPs (small nucleotide polymorphisms) leads to a larger discovery
	of eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) than with arrays. We
	also detect a substantial number of variants that influence the structure
	of mature transcripts indicating variants responsible for alternative
	splicing. Finally, measures of allele-specific expression allowed
	the identification of rare eQTLs and allelic differences in transcript
	structure. This analysis shows that high throughput sequencing technologies
	reveal new properties of genetic effects on the transcriptome and
	allow the exploration of genetic effects in cellular processes.},

@article{Novembre08PCGeography,
	Abstract = {Understanding the genetic structure of human populations is of fundamental
	interest to medical, forensic and anthropological sciences. Advances
	in high-throughput genotyping technology have markedly improved our
	understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and suggest
	the potential to use large samples to uncover variation among closely
	spaced populations. Here we characterize genetic variation in a sample
	of 3,000 European individuals genotyped at over half a million variable
	DNA sites in the human genome. Despite low average levels of genetic
	differentiation among Europeans, we find a close correspondence between
	genetic and geographic distances; indeed, a geographical map of Europe
	arises naturally as an efficient two-dimensional summary of genetic
	variation in Europeans. The results emphasize that when mapping the
	genetic basis of a disease phenotype, spurious associations can arise
	if genetic structure is not properly accounted for. In addition,
	the results are relevant to the prospects of genetic ancestry testing;
	an individual's DNA can be used to infer their geographic origin
	with surprising accuracy-often to within a few hundred kilometres.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Forward-time simulations have unique advantages
	in power and flexibility for the simulation of genetic samples of
	complex human diseases because they can closely mimic the evolution
	of human populations carrying these diseases. However, a number of
	methodological and computational constraints have prevented the power
	of this simulation method from being fully explored in existing forward-time
	simulation methods. RESULTS: Using a general-purpose forward-time
	population genetics simulation environment, we developed a forward-time
	simulation method that can be used to simulate realistic samples
	for genome-wide association studies. We examined the properties of
	this simulation method by comparing simulated samples with real data
	and demonstrated its wide applicability using four examples, including
	a simulation of case-control samples with a disease caused by multiple
	interacting genetic and environmental factors, a simulation of trio
	families affected by a disease-predisposing allele that had been
	subjected to either slow or rapid selective sweep, and a simulation
	of a structured population resulting from recent population admixture.
	CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm simulates populations that closely resemble
	the complex structure of the human genome, while allows the introduction
	of signals of natural selection. Because of its flexibility to generate
	different types of samples with arbitrary disease or quantitative
	trait models, this simulation method can simulate realistic samples
	to evaluate the performance of a wide variety of statistical gene
	mapping methods for genome-wide association studies.},

@article{Pink11PseudoGene,
	Abstract = {Pseudogenes have long been labeled as ``junk'' DNA, failed copies of
	genes that arise during the evolution of genomes. However, recent
	results are challenging this moniker; indeed, some pseudogenes appear
	to harbor the potential to regulate their protein-coding cousins.
	Far from being silent relics, many pseudogenes are transcribed into
	RNA, some exhibiting a tissue-specific pattern of activation. Pseudogene
	transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs that regulate
	coding genes through the RNAi pathway. In another remarkable discovery,
	it has been shown that pseudogenes are capable of regulating tumor
	suppressors and oncogenes by acting as microRNA decoys. The finding
	that pseudogenes are often deregulated during cancer progression
	warrants further investigation into the true extent of pseudogene
	function. In this review, we describe the ways in which pseudogenes
	exert their effect on coding genes and explore the role of pseudogenes
	in the increasingly complex web of noncoding RNA that contributes
	to normal cellular regulation.},

	We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict
	clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably,
	signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when
	combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally,
	we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures
	of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies
	that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression
	profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents
	provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using
	them in combination with existing targeted therapies. }},

	for identifying susceptibility genes. We describe a statistical method
	for detecting association of multiple rare variants in protein-coding

	on the regression of phenotypic values on individuals' genotype scores
	subject to a variable allele-frequency threshold, incorporating computational
	predictions of the functional effects of missense variants. Statistical
	significance is assessed by permutation testing with variable thresholds.
	We used a rigorous population-genetics simulation framework to evaluate

	Abstract = {<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Trastuzumab dramatically improves
	survival in breast cancer patients whose tumor overexpresses HER2.
	A subpopulation of cells in human breast tumors has been identified
	with characteristics of cancer stem cells. These breast cancer stem-like
	cells (BCSCs) rely on HER2 signaling for self-renewal, suggesting
	that HER2-targeted therapy targets BCSCs even when the bulk of the
	tumor does not overexpress HER2. In order to guide clinical trials
	examining HER2-targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting, we propose
	a mathematical model to examine BCSC population dynamics and predict
	optimal duration of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Varying
	the susceptibility of BCSCs to HER2-targeted therapy, we quantify
	the average time to extinction of BCSCs. We expand our model using
	stochastic simulation to include the partially differentiated tumor
	cells (TCs) that represent bulk tumor population and examine effects
	of plasticity on required duration of therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Lower
	susceptibility of BCSCs and increased rates of dedifferentiation
	entail longer extinction times, indicating a need for prolonged administration
	of HER2-targeted therapy. We predict that even when therapy does
	not appreciably reduce tumor size in the advanced cancer setting,
	it will eventually eradicate the tumor in the adjuvant setting as
	long as there is at least a modest effect on BCSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We
	anticipate that our results will inform clinical trials of targeted
	therapies in planning the duration of therapy needed to eradicate
	BCSCs. Our predictions also address safety, as longer duration of
	therapy entails a greater potential impact on normal stem cells that
	may also be susceptible to stem cell-targeted therapies.</p></sec>},

	Abstract = {In biomedical studies, researchers are often interested in assessing
	the association between one or more ordinal explanatory variables
	and an outcome variable, at the same time adjusting for covariates
	of any type. The outcome variable may be continuous, binary, or represent
	censored survival times. In the absence of precise knowledge of the
	response function, using monotonicity constraints on the ordinal
	variables improves efficiency in estimating parameters, especially
	when sample sizes are small. An active set algorithm that can efficiently
	compute such estimators is proposed, and a characterization of the
	solution is provided. Having an efficient algorithm at hand is especially
	relevant when applying likelihood ratio tests in restricted generalized
	linear models, where one needs the value of the likelihood at the
	restricted maximizer. The algorithm is illustrated on a real life
	data set from oncology.},

@article{ScheetStephens2006,
	Abstract = {We present a statistical model for patterns of genetic variation in
	samples of unrelated individuals from natural populations. This model
	is based on the idea that, over short regions, haplotypes in a population
	tend to cluster into groupsof similar haplotypes. To capture the
	fact that, because of recombination, this clustering tends to be
	local in nature, our model allows cluster memberships to change continuously
	along the chromosome according to a hidden Markov model. This approach
	is flexible, allowing for both \&quot;block-like\&quot; patterns
	of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and gradual decline in LD with distance.
	The resulting modelis also fast and, as a result, is practicable
	for large data sets (e.g., thousands of individuals typed at hundreds
	of thousands of markers). We illustrate the utility of the model
	by applying it to dense single-nucleotide-polymorphism genotype data
	for the tasks of imputing missing genotypes and estimating haplotypic
	phase. For imputing missing genotypes, methods based on this model
	are as accurate or more accurate than existing methods. For haplotype
	estimation, the point estimates are slightly less accurate than those
	from the best existing methods (e.g., for unrelated Centre d'Etude
	duPolymorphisme Humain individuals from the HapMap project, switch
	error was 0.055for our method vs. 0.051 for PHASE) but require a
	small fraction of the computational cost. In addition, we demonstrate
	that the model accurately reflects uncertainty in its estimates,
	in that probabilities computed using the model are approximately
	well calibrated. The methods described in this article are implemented
	in a software package, fastPHASE, which is available from the Stephens
	Lab Web site.},

	of proteins into a mixture of Dirichlet densities over amino acid
	distributions. Dirichlet mixture densities are designed to be combined
	with observed amino acid frequencies to form estimates of expected
	amino acid probabilities at each position in a profile, hidden Markov
	model or other statistical model. These estimates give a statistical
	model greater generalization capacity, so that remotely related family
	members can be more reliably recognized by the model. This paper
	corrects the previously published formula for estimating these expected
	probabilities, and contains complete derivations of the Dirichlet
	mixture formulas, methods for optimizing the mixtures to match particular
	databases, and suggestions for efficient implementation.},

	Abstract = {{The introduction of stochastic methods in pedigree analysis has enabled
	geneticists to tackle computations intractable by standard deterministic
	methods. Until now these stochastic techniques have worked by running
	a Markov chain on the set of genetic descent states of a pedigree.
	Each descent state specifies the paths of gene flow in the pedigree
	and the founder alleles dropped down each path. The current paper
	follows up on a suggestion by Elizabeth Thompson that genetic descent
	graphs offer a more appropriate space for executing a Markov chain.
	A descent graph specifies the paths of gene flow but not the particular
	founder alleles traveling down the paths. This paper explores algorithms
	for implementing Thompson's suggestion for codominant markers in
	the context of automatic haplotyping, estimating location scores,
	and computing gene-clustering statistics for robust linkage analysis.
	Realistic numerical examples demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithms.}},

	Abstract = {10.1101/gr.3804205 We find that the degree of impairment of protein
	function by missense variants is predictable by comparative sequence
	analysis alone. The applicable range of impairment is not confined
	to binary predictions that distinguish normal from deleterious variants,
	but extends continuously from mild to severe effects. The accuracy
	of predictions is strongly dependent on sequence variation and is
	highest when diverse orthologs are available. High predictive accuracy
	is achieved by quantification of the physicochemical characteristics
	in each position of the protein, based on observed evolutionary variation.
	The strong relationship between physicochemical characteristics of
	a missense variant and impairment of protein function extends to
	human disease. By using four diverse proteins for which sufficient
	comparative sequence data are available, we show that grades of disease,
	or likelihood of developing cancer, correlate strongly with physicochemical
	constraint violation by causative amino acid variants.},

@article{Suchard10GPU,
	Abstract = {{This article describes advances in statistical computation for large-scale
	data analysis in structured Bayesian mixture models via graphics
	processing unit (GPU) programming. The developments are partly motivated
	by computational challenges arising in fitting models of increasing
	heterogeneity to increasingly large datasets. An example context
	concerns common biological studies using high-throughput technologies
	generating many, very large datasets and requiring increasingly high-dimensional
	mixture models with large numbers of mixture components. We outline
	important strategies and processes for GPU computation in Bayesian
	simulation and optimization approaches, give examples of the benefits
	of GPU implementations in terms of processing speed and scale-up
	in ability to analyze large datasets, and provide a detailed, tutorial-style
	exposition that will benefit readers interested in developing GPU-based
	approaches in other statistical models. Novel, GPU-oriented approaches
	to modifying existing algorithms software design can lead to vast
	speed-up and, critically, enable statistical analyses that presently
	will not be performed due to compute time limitations in traditional
	computational environments. Supplemental materials are provided with
	all source code, example data, and details that will enable readers
	to implement and explore the GPU approach in this mixture modeling
	context.}},

	Abstract = {Accurate and rapid identification of perturbed pathways through the
	analysis of genome-wide expression profiles facilitates the generation
	of biological hypotheses. We propose a statistical framework for
	determining whether a specified group of genes for a pathway has
	a coordinated association with a phenotype of interest. Several issues
	on proper hypothesis-testing procedures are clarified. In particular,
	it is shown that the differences in the correlation structure of
	each set of genes can lead to a biased comparison among gene sets
	unless a normalization procedure is applied. We propose statistical
	tests for two important but different aspects of association for
	each group of genes. This approach has more statistical power than
	currently available methods and can result in the discovery of statistically
	significant pathways that are not detected by other methods. This
	method is applied to data sets involving diabetes, inflammatory myopathies,
	and Alzheimer's disease, using gene sets we compiled from various

	Abstract = {{This paper studies a difficult and fundamental problem that arises
	throughout electrical engineering, applied mathematics, and statistics.
	Suppose that one forms a short linear combination of elementary signals
	drawn from a large, fixed collection. Given an observation of the
	linear combination that has been contaminated with additive noise,
	the goal is to identify which elementary signals participated and
	to approximate their coefficients. Although many algorithms have
	been proposed, there is little theory which guarantees that these
	algorithms can accurately and efficiently solve the problem. This
	paper studies a method called convex relaxation, which attempts to
	recover the ideal sparse signal by solving a convex program. This
	approach is powerful because the optimization can be completed in
	polynomial time with standard scientific software. The paper provides
	general conditions which ensure that convex relaxation succeeds.
	As evidence of the broad impact of these results, the paper describes
	how convex relaxation can be used for several concrete signal recovery
	problems. It also describes applications to channel coding, linear
	regression, and numerical analysis}},

@article{TzengZhang07ScoreTest,
	Abstract = {{Haplotypes provide a more informative format of polymorphisms for
	genetic association analysis than do individual single-nucleotide
	polymorphisms. However, the practical efficacy of haplotype-based
	association analysis is challenged by a trade-off between the benefits
	of modeling abundant variation and the cost of the extra degrees
	of freedom. To reduce the degrees of freedom, several strategies
	have been considered in the literature. They include (1) clustering
	evolutionarily close haplotypes, (2) modeling the level of haplotype
	sharing, and (3) smoothing haplotype effects by introducing a correlation
	structure for haplotype effects and studying the variance components
	(VC) for association. Although the first two strategies enjoy a fair
	extent of power gain, empirical evidence showed that VC methods may
	exhibit only similar or less power than the standard haplotype regression
	method, even in cases of many haplotypes. In this study, we report
	possible reasons that cause the underpowered phenomenon and show
	how the power of the VC strategy can be improved. We construct a
	score test based on the restricted maximum likelihood or the marginal
	likelihood function of the VC and identify its nontypical limiting
	distribution. Through simulation, we demonstrate the validity of
	the test and investigate the power performance of the VC approach
	and that of the standard haplotype regression approach. With suitable
	choices for the correlation structure, the proposed method can be
	directly applied to unphased genotypic data. Our method is applicable
	to a wide-ranging class of models and is computationally efficient
	and easy to implement. The broad coverage and the fast and easy implementation
	of this method make the VC strategy an effective tool for haplotype
	analysis, even in modern genomewide association studies.}},

@article{TzengBondell10HaplotypePenalty,
	Abstract = {{Haplotypes can hold key information to understand the role of candidate
	genes in disease etiology. However, standard haplotype analysis has
	yet been able to fully reveal the information retained by haplotypes.
	In most analysis, haplotype inference focuses on relative effects
	compared with an arbitrarily chosen baseline haplotype. It does not
	depict the effect structure unless an additional inference procedure
	is used in a secondary post hoc analysis, and such analysis tends
	to be lack of power. In this study, we propose a penalized regression
	approach to systematically evaluate the pattern and structure of
	the haplotype effects. By specifying an L1 penalty on the pairwise
	difference of the haplotype effects, we present a model-based haplotype
	analysis to detect and to characterize the haplotypic association
	signals. The proposed method avoids the need to choose a baseline
	haplotype; it simultaneously carries out the effect estimation and
	effect comparison of all haplotypes, and outputs the haplotype group
	structure based on their effect size. Finally, our penalty weights
	are theoretically designed to balance the likelihood and the penalty
	term in an appropriate manner. The proposed method can be used as
	a tool to comprehend candidate regions identified from a genome or
	chromosomal scan. Simulation studies reveal the better abilities
	of the proposed method to identify the haplotype effect structure
	compared with the traditional haplotype association methods, demonstrating
	the informativeness and powerfulness of the proposed method.}},

	Abstract = {Schizophrenia is a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder whose genetic
	influences remain elusive. We hypothesize that individually rare
	structural variants contribute to the illness. Microdeletions and
	microduplications >100 kilobases were identified by microarray comparative
	genomic hybridization of genomic DNA from 150 individuals with schizophrenia
	and 268 ancestry-matched controls. All variants were validated by
	high-resolution platforms. Novel deletions and duplications of genes
	were present in 5% of controls versus 15% of cases and 20% of young-onset
	cases, both highly significant differences. The association was independently
	replicated in patients with childhood-onset schizophrenia as compared
	with their parents. Mutations in cases disrupted genes disproportionately
	from signaling networks controlling neurodevelopment, including neuregulin
	and glutamate pathways. These results suggest that multiple, individually
	rare mutations altering genes in neurodevelopmental pathways contribute
	to schizophrenia.},

@article{Wang07SCADBIC,
	Abstract = {The penalized least squares approach with smoothly clipped absolute
	deviation penalty has been consistently demonstrated to be an attractive
	regression shrinkage and selection method. It not only automatically
	and consistently selects the important variables, but also produces
	estimators which are as efficient as the oracle estimator. However,
	these attractive features depend on appropriate choice of the tuning
	parameter. We show that the commonly used generalized crossvalidation
	cannot select the tuning parameter satisfactorily, with a nonignorable
	overfitting effect in the resulting model. In addition, we propose
	a BIC tuning parameter selector, which is shown to be able to identify
	the true model consistently. Simulation studies are presented to
	support theoretical findings, and an empirical example is given to
	illustrate its use in the Female Labor Supply data.},

	is proposed. Compared with the traditional inverse regression methods
	[e.g., sliced inverse regression (SIR)], the new method is free of
	the linearity condition and has much better estimation accuracy.
	Compared with the direct estimation methods (e.g., MAVE), the new
	method is much more robust against extreme values and can capture
	the entire central subspace (CS) exhaustively. To determine the CS
	dimension, a consistent cross-validation criterion is developed.

	Abstract = {{The first part of this article presents the Monte Carlo implementation
	of the E step of the EM algorithm. Given the current guess to the
	maximizer of the posterior distribution, latent data patterns are
	generated from the conditional predictive distribution. The expected
	value of the augmented log-posterior is then updated as a mixture
	of augmented log-posteriors, mixed over the generated latent data
	patterns (multiple imputations). In the M step of the algorithm,
	this mixture is maximized to obtain the update to the maximizer of
	the observed posterior. The gradient and Hessian of the observed
	log posterior are also expressed as mixtures, mixed over the multiple
	imputations. The relation between the Monte Carlo EM (MCEM) algorithm
	and the data augmentation algorithm is noted. Two modifications to
	the MCEM algorithm (the poor man's data augmentation algorithms),
	which allow for the calculation of the entire posterior, are then
	presented. These approximations serve as diagnostics for the validity
	of the normal approximation to the posterior, as well as starting
	points for the full data augmentation analysis. The methodology is
	illustrated with two examples.}},

	With its use one can obtain a simple closed-form estimate of the

	estimates, and thus approximate sample sizes needed to test hypotheses
	about the parameters. The method is developed for selected distributions
	of a single covariate and for a class of exponential-type distributions

@article{Wu10KernelMachine,
	Abstract = {{GWAS have emerged as popular tools for identifying genetic variants
	that are associated with disease risk. Standard analysis of a case-control
	GWAS involves assessing the association between each individual genotyped
	SNP and disease risk. However, this approach suffers from limited
	reproducibility and difficulties in detecting multi-SNP and epistatic
	effects. As an alternative analytical strategy, we propose grouping
	SNPs together into SNP sets on the basis of proximity to genomic
	features such as genes or haplotype blocks, then testing the joint
	effect of each SNP set. Testing of each SNP set proceeds via the
	logistic kernel-machine-based test, which is based on a statistical
	framework that allows for flexible modeling of epistatic and nonlinear
	SNP effects. This flexibility and the ability to naturally adjust
	for covariate effects are important features of our test that make
	it appealing in comparison to individual SNP tests and existing multimarker
	tests. Using simulated data based on the International HapMap Project,
	we show that SNP-set testing can have improved power over standard
	individual-SNP analysis under a wide range of settings. In particular,
	we find that our approach has higher power than individual-SNP analysis
	when the median correlation between the disease-susceptibility variant
	and the genotyped SNPs is moderate to high. When the correlation
	is low, both individual-SNP analysis and the SNP-set analysis tend
	to have low power. We apply SNP-set analysis to analyze the Cancer
	Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) breast cancer GWAS discovery-phase
	data.}},

@article{WuChenHastieSobelLange09PenLogistic,
	Abstract = {Motivation: In ordinary regression, imposition of a lasso penalty
	makes continuous model selection straightforward. Lasso penalized
	regression is particularly advantageous when the number of predictors
	far exceeds the number of observations. Method: The present article
	evaluates the performance of lasso penalized logistic regression
	in case-control disease gene mapping with a large number of SNPs
	(single nucleotide polymorphisms) predictors. The strength of the
	lasso penalty can be tuned to select a predetermined number of the
	most relevant SNPs and other predictors. For a given value of the
	tuning constant, the penalized likelihood is quickly maximized by
	cyclic coordinate ascent. Once the most potent marginal predictors
	are identified, their two-way and higher order interactions can also
	be examined by lasso penalized logistic regression. Results: This
	strategy is tested on both simulated and real data. Our findings
	on coeliac disease replicate the previous SNP results and shed light
	on possible interactions among the SNPs. Availability: The software
	discussed is available in Mendel 9.0 at the UCLA Human Genetics web
	site. Contact: klange@ucla.edu Supplementary information: Supplementary
	data are available at Bioinformatics online. 10.1093/bioinformatics/btp041},

@article{WuLange10DA,
	Abstract = {Summary: In response to the challenges of data mining, discriminant
	analysis continues to evolve as a vital branch of statistics. Our
	recently introduced method of vertex discriminant analysis (VDA)
	is ideally suited to handle multiple categories and an excess of
	predictors over training cases. The current paper explores an elaboration
	of VDA that conducts classification and variable selection simultaneously.
	Adding lasso ($\ell _{1}$-norm) and Euclidean penalties to the VDA
	loss function eliminates unnecessary predictors. Lasso penalties
	apply to each predictor coefficient separately; Euclidean penalties
	group the collective coefficients of a single predictor. With these
	penalties in place, cyclic coordinate descent accelerates estimation
	of all coefficients. Our tests on simulated and benchmark real data
	demonstrate the virtues of penalized VDA in model building and prediction
	in high-dimensional settings.},

@article{Yang10HeightHeritability,
	Abstract = {{SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account
	for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits
	in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated
	the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831
	SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model
	analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based
	on the observed genotype data. We show that 45\% of variance can
	be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of
	the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected
	because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance
	tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due
	to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and
	genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor
	allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.}},

	Comment = {* narrow-sense heritability: proportion of phenotypic variance due to additive genetic variance * Where is the missing heritability? Suggested explanations include the existence of gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions, the common disease{\^O}{\ae}{\^e}rare variant hypothesis and the possibility that inherited epigenetic factors cause resemblance between relatives. * There are two logical explanations for the failure of validated SNP associations to explain the estimated heritability: either the causal variants each explain such a small amount of variation that their effects do not reach stringent significance thresholds and/or the causal variants are not in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the SNPs that have been genotyped. * Here, instead of testing each SNP individually for an association with the trait, they fit all the SNPs simultaneously. The effects of the SNPs are treated statistically as random, and the variance explained by all the SNPs together is estimated. This approach does not attempt to test the significance of individual SNPs but provides an unbiased estimate of the variance explained by the SNPs in total. * Model (j: individual, i: SNP, m: nb of causal variants): y\_j = mu + g\_j + e\_j with g\_j = Sum\_i^m z\_\_ij u\_ij * 3925 unrelated individuals, by REML they estimated the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by the SNPs as 0.45 (s.e.=0.08). * After correcting for incomplete LD between genotyped SNPs and causal variants, they estimated the proportion of variance explained by causal variants to be 0.54 (s.e.=0.10). * After assuming that the MAF of causal variants is <0.1, they estimated the proportion of variance in height explained by causal variants to be 0.84 (s.e.=0.16). * Although the standard error is high, this result is consistent with causal variants being, on average, at lower frequency than the SNPs used on commercial arrays and therefore in less LD with these SNPs than the LD of the SNPs with other SNPs. This does not prove that the causal variants have MAF < 0.1, but it shows that if this were the case, they could explain the estimated heritability of height (\~{}0.8). * They checked that, after correcting for incomplete LD between SNPs and causal variants, the variance explained by the causal variants does not depend on the number of SNPs used.},

@article{YuanLin07Garrotte,
	Abstract = { We study the non-negative garrotte estimator from three different
	aspects: consistency, computation and flexibility. We argue that
	the non-negative garrotte is a general procedure that can be used
	in combination with estimators other than the original least squares
	estimator as in its original form. In particular, we consider using
	the lasso, the elastic net and ridge regression along with ordinary
	least squares as the initial estimate in the non-negative garrotte.
	We prove that the non-negative garrotte has the nice property that,
	with probability tending to 1, the solution path contains an estimate
	that correctly identifies the set of important variables and is consistent
	for the coefficients of the important variables, whereas such a property
	may not be valid for the initial estimators. In general, we show
	that the non-negative garrotte can turn a consistent estimate into
	an estimate that is not only consistent in terms of estimation but
	also in terms of variable selection. We also show that the non-negative
	garrotte has a piecewise linear solution path. Using this fact, we
	propose an efficient algorithm for computing the whole solution path
	for the non-negative garrotte. Simulations and a real example demonstrate
	that the non-negative garrotte is very effective in improving on
	the initial estimator in terms of variable selection and estimation
	accuracy. Copyright 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

	Abstract = {The non-linear programming problem seeks to maximize a function f(x)
	where the n component vector x must satisfy certain constraints <tex-math>$g_{i}(x)=0,i=1,\cdot
	\cdot \cdot ,m^{1}$</tex-math> and <tex-math>$g_{i}(x)\geq 0,i=m^{1}+1,\cdot
	\cdot \cdot ,m$</tex-math>. The algorithm presented in this paper
	solves the non-linear programming problem by transforming it into
	a sequence of unconstrained maximization problems. Essentially, a
	penalty is imposed whenever x does not satisfy the constraints. Although
	the algorithm appears most useful in the concave case, the convergence
	proof holds for non-concave functions as well. The algorithm is especially
	interesting in the concave case because the programming problem reduces
	to a single unconstrained maximization problem or, at most, to a
	finite sequence of unconstrained maximization problems. In addition,
	the paper presents a new class of dual problems, and the algorithm
	is shown to be a dual feasible method. Another property of the algorithm
	is that it appears particularly well suited for large-scale problems
	with a sizable number of constraints.},

@article{ZhouZhouSobelLange14GAW18,
	Abstract = {The linkage era left a rich legacy of pedigree samples that can be
	used for modern genome-wide association sequencing (GWAS) or next-generation
	sequencing (NGS) studies. Family designs are naturally equipped to
	detect rare variants, control for population stratification, and
	facilitate the study of parent-of-origin effects. Unfortunately,
	pedigree likelihoods are notoriously hard to compute, and current
	software for association mapping in pedigrees is prohibitively slow
	in processing dense marker maps. In a recent release of the comprehensive
	genetic analysis software MENDEL, we implemented an ultra-fast score
	test for association mapping with pedigree-based GWAS or NGS study
	data. Our implementation (a) works for random sample data, pedigree
	data, or a mix of both;(b) allows for covariate adjustment, including
	correction for population stratification;(c) accommodates both univariate
	and multivariate quantitative traits; and (d) allows missing values
	in multivariate traits. In this paper, we assess the capabilities
	of MENDEL on the Genetic Analysis Workshop 18 sequencing data. For
	instance, when jointly testing the 4 longitudinally measured diastolic
	blood pressure traits, it takes MENDEL less than 51 minutes on a
	standard laptop computer to read, quality check, and analyze a data
	set with 959 individuals and 8.3 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms
	(SNPs). Our analysis reveals association of one SNP in the q32.2
	region of chromosome 1. MENDEL is freely available on http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/software

@article{Zhou12CCImpute,
	Abstract = {Although mapping quantitative traits in inbred strains is simpler
	than mapping the analogous traits in humans, classical inbred crosses
	suffer from reduced genetic diversity compared to experimental designs
	involving outbred animal populations. Multiple crosses, for example
	the Complex Trait Consortium's eight-way cross, circumvent these
	difficulties. However, complex mating schemes and systematic inbreeding
	raise substantial computational difficulties. Here we present a method
	for locally imputing the strain origins of each genotyped animal
	along its genome. Imputed origins then serve as mean effects in a
	multivariate Gaussian model for testing association between trait
	levels and local genomic variation. Imputation is a combinatorial
	process that assigns the maternal and paternal strain origin of each
	animal on the basis of observed genotypes and prior pedigree information.
	Without smoothing, imputation is likely to be ill-defined or jump
	erratically from one strain to another as an animal's genome is traversed.
	In practice, one expects to see long stretches where strain origins
	are invariant. Smoothing can be achieved by penalizing strain changes
	from one marker to the next. A dynamic programming algorithm then
	solves the strain imputation process in one quick pass through the
	genome of an animal. Imputation accuracy exceeds 99% in practical
	examples and leads to high-resolution mapping in simulated and real
	data. The previous fastest quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping
	software for dense genome scans reduced compute times to hours. Our
	implementation further reduces compute times from hours to minutes
	with no loss in statistical power. Indeed, power is enhanced for
	full pedigree data.},
