* [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) (thanks to Brendon Chau): Run native Linux terminal on Windows. 

* `ssh username@server.biostat-m280.info` vs `ssh -i ~/.ssh/key_file username@server.biostat-m280.info`. By default, `ssh` will search `~/.ssh/id_dsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` for private key. If using other names, then use argument `-i` to explicitly tell `ssh`  the private key to use.
