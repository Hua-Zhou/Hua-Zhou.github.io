Welcome to Biostat 203B: *Introduction to Data Science*. 

## Today

* Introduction and course logistics  
* Linux basics

## Homework (not graded)

* Fill out a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/NGC8N8V). It helps me better taylor the course to your background.

* If you have not used R/RStudio before, 
  0. Download and install R v3.5.1 or later versions from [http://cran.stat.ucla.edu](http://cran.stat.ucla.edu)   
  0. Download and install RStudio Desktop Open Source Edition from [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop) 
  
* Accessing the teaching server:
  0. There is a teaching server you can use for exercise and homework. The ip address is `server.biostat-m280.info` or `35.235.104.58`.  
  0. An account has been created for those enrolled in the class. The username is same as that in your email address in MyUCLA. The temporary password is same as your username. E.g., if you email is `joe_bruin@ucla.edu`, then the username for your account on teaching server is `joe_bruin` and the temporary password is `m280`.  
  0. Try to log in by `ssh username@server.biostat-m280.info` on Mac terminal or using PuTTY on Windows.  
  0. After log in using your temporary password, issue command `passwd` to change your password to a more secure one *immediately*. If you don't change your password, anyone can log in your account and mess up your files.  
  0. Later we will learn how to set up the more secure key authentification.  
  0. Both `R` and `RStudio`  are installed on the teaching server. You can access and use `RStudio` on the server by pointing your browser to address [http://server.biostat-m280.info:8787](http://server.biostat-m280.info:8787).  
  0. This server is for education purpose. You are **not** allowed to run simulations or any program unrelated to this class.
