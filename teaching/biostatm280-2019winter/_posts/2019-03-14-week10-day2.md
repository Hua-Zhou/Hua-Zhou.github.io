## FAQ 

There are various issues installing RStudio/keras on Windows. Below is a solution provided by Edward Yu ([@edwardmjyu](https://github.com/edwardmjyu)):

The issue in more detail and its solution is found here: 
<https://github.com/rstudio/keras/issues/626>

Below are the steps for the solution: 
Only thing that did work (executed in the following order):

1. installation of R 3.5.2 (independent from directory (standard or any other))
2. installation of RStudio (independent from directory)
3. RStudio -> Tools -> Global Options -> Packages -> Disable both "Use secure download method for HTTP" and "Use Internet Explorer library/proxy for HTTP"
4. installation of Miniconda3 (-> has to be the standard directory!) Version 4.5.11 (it did not work with the newest version)
5. Use RStudio ->
```{r}
install.packages("tensorflow")
install.packages("keras")
library("keras")
install_keras() 
```
One caveat in the installation process is the version of Miniconda, there may be potential issues if the newest version of miniconda is installed.

## What I didn't cover

- Machine/statistical learning methods. Familiar with methods in _Elements of Statistical Learning_ and software, e.g., _scikit-learn_.  

- Algorithms. 

- Public health applications.

- Be open to languages. **Python** is a more generic programming language and widely adopted in data science. **JavaScript** is dominant in web applications. **Scala** is popular for implementing distributed programs. **Julia** is attractive for high performance scientific computing.
