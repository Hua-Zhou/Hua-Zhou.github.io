* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-m280-2019-winter` public (after final week) and show your work to backup your resume.

* **Use** these skills in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your daily work (homework, research projects), give presentation using R Markdown and Shiny, write blog/tutorial, ...

## What I didn't cover

- Machine/statistical learning methods. Familiar with methods in _Elements of Statistical Learning_ and software, e.g., _scikit-learn_.

- Algorithms. 

- Public health applications.

- Be open to languages. Python is a more generic programming language and widely adopted in data science. Scala is popular for implementing distributed programs. Julia is attractive for high performance scientific computing.
