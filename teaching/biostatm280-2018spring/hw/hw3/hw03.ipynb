    "Those who took my _203B: Introduction to Data Science_ last quarter had a (painful) experience of wrangling an Apache Spark cluster to do linear regression on a dataset with more than 100 million observations. Now we learnt various methods for solving linear regression and should realize that, with right choice of algorithm, it is a problem that can be handled by any moderate computer."

Therefore $\\mathbf{x}$ serves as page ranks: a higher $x_i$ means page $i$ is more visited. It is well-known that $\\mathbf{x}$ is the left eigenvector corresponding to the top eigenvalue 1 of the transition matrix $\\mathbf{P}$. That is $\\mathbf{P}^T \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{x}$. Therefore $\\mathbf{x}$ can be solved as an eigen-problem. Show that it can also be cast as solving a linear system. Since the row sums of $\\mathbf{P}$ are 1, $\\mathbf{P}$ is rank deficient. We can replace the first equation by the $\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 1$."
