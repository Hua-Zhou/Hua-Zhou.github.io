## Announcement

* HW4 (due 6/12) and HW5 (due 6/15) are posted.  

* Sign-up sheet.  

## Today

* Newton and Fisher scoring algorithm (cont'd).

* HW2 feedback.

	* NNMF: Multiplication order matters: `V * W * W'` vs `V * (W * W')`. Avoid matrix transpose in loop: `W * W` vs `A_mul_Bt(W, W)`. Avoid allocating arrays in loop: `A_mul_Bt(W, W)` vs `A_mul_Bt!(storage, W, W)`. 

	* LMM: `easy + low rank` structure.

* HW3 feedback:

	* Big $n$ regression: although `X, y` may be too large to fit into memory, sufficient statistics `X'X` and `X'y` has fixed size.

	* PageRank: `easy + low rank` structure. Make sure to use this structure in iterative algorithms.
