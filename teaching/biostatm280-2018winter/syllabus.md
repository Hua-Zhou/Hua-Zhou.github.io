See the university’s policy on academic integrity at [http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/StudentGuide.pdf](http://www.deanofstudents.ucla.edu/Portals/16/Documents/StudentGuide.pdf). You may discuss with your fellow students on homework assignments, but simply giving or receiving answers or code to or from another student is cheating. Cheating also includes copying from another student’s paper or code, using unauthorized materials during exams, and falsifying data.
