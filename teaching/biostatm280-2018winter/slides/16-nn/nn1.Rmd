## Single layer neural network 

- Aka single layer perceptron (SLP) or single hidden layer back-propagation network.

- Sum of nonlinear functions of linear combinations of the inputs, typically represented by a **network diagram**.

<p align="center">
![](./esl-fig-11-2.png){width=500px}
</p>

- Mathematical model:
\begin{eqnarray*}
Z_m &=& \sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \alpha_m^T X), \quad m = 1, \ldots, M \\
T_k &=& \beta_{0k} + \beta_k^T Z, \quad k = 1,\ldots, K \\
Y_k &=& f_k(X) = g_k(T), \quad k = 1, \ldots, K.
\end{eqnarray*}  

    - **Output layer**: $Y=(Y_1, \ldots, Y_K)$ are $K$-dimensional output.         For univariate response, $K=1$; for $K$-class classification, $k$-th unit models the probability of class $k$.  
    
    - **Input layer**: $X=(X_1, \ldots, X_p)$ are $p$-dimensional input features. 
    
    - **Hidden layer**: $Z=(Z_1, \ldots, Z_M)$ are derived features created from linear combinations of inputs $X$.
    
    - $T=(T_1, \ldots, T_K)$ are the output features that are directly associated with the outputs $Y$ through output functions $g_k(\cdot)$.
    
    - $g_k(T) = T$ for regression. $g_k(T) = e^{T_k} / \sum_{k=1}^K e^{T_k}$ for $K$-class classification (**softmax regression**).
    
    - Number of **weights** (parameters) is $M(p+1) + K(M+1)$.
    
- **Activation function** $\sigma$:  

    - $\sigma(v)=$ a step function: human brain models where each unit represents a neuron, and the connections represent synapses; the neurons fired when the total signal passed to that unit exceeded a certain threshold.

    - **Sigmoid** function:
    $$
    \sigma(v) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-v}}.
    $$
    <p align="center">
    ![](./esl-fig-11-3.png){width=500px}
    </p>    
    
    - **Rectifier**. $\sigma(v) = v_+ = max(0, v)$. A unit employing the rectifier is called a **rectified linear unit (ReLU)**. According to Wikipedia:  
    > The rectifier is, as of 2018, the most popular activation function for deep neural networks.    
    
    - **Softplus**. $\sigma(v) = \log (1 + \exp v)$.
<p align="center">
![](./Rectifier_and_softplus_functions.svg){width=400px}
</p>
    
- Given training data $(X_1, Y_1), \ldots, (X_n, Y_n)$, the **loss function** $L$ can be:

    - Sum of squares error (SSE):
    $$
      L = \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^n [y_{ik} - f_k(x_i)]^2.
    $$
    
    - Cross-entropy (deviance):
    $$
      L = - \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{i=1}^n y_{ik} \log f_k(x_i).
    $$
    
- Model fitting: **back-propagation** (gradient descent)

    - Consider sum of squares error and let
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    z_{mi} &=& \sigma(\alpha_{0m} + \alpha_m^T x_i) \\
    R_i &=& \sum_{k=1}^K [y_{ik} - f_k(x_i)]^2.
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    - The derivatives:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \beta_{km}} &=& -2 [y_{ik} - f_k(x_i)] g_k'(\beta_k^T z_i) z_{mi} \equiv \delta_{ki} z_{mi} \\
      \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \alpha_{ml}} &=& - 2 \sum_{k=1}^K [y_{ik} - f_k(x_i)] g_k'(\beta_k^T z_i) \beta_{km} \sigma'(\alpha_m^T x_i) x_{il} \equiv s_{mi} x_{il}.
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    - Gradient descent update:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \beta_{km}^{(r+1)} &=& \beta_{km}^{(r)} - \gamma_r \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \beta_{km}} \\
      \alpha_{ml}^{(r+1)} &=& \alpha_{ml}^{(r)} - \gamma_r \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial R_i}{\partial \alpha_{ml}},
    \end{eqnarray*}
    where $\gamma_r$ is the **learning rate**.
    
    - Back-propagation equations
    $$
      s_{mi} = \sigma'(\alpha_m^T x_i) \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{km} \delta_{ki}.
    $$
    
    - Two-pass updates:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    & & \text{initialization} \to \hat f_k(x_i) \quad \quad \quad \text{(forward pass)}   \\
    &\to& \delta_{ki} \to s_{mi} \to \hat \beta_{km} \text{ and } \hat \alpha_{ml} \quad \quad \text{(backward pass)}.
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
    - Advantages: each hidden units passes and receives information only to and from units that share a connection; can be implemented efficiently on a parallel architecture computer.
    
<!-- - Alternative fitting methods: conjugate gradients, variable metric methods. -->

- Stochastic gradient descent (**SGD**). In real machine learning applications, training set can be large. Back-propagation over all training cases can be expensive. Learning can also be carried out **online** — processing each batch one at a time, updating the gradient after each training batch, and cycling through the training cases many times. A training **epoch** refers to one sweep through the entire training set.

    **AdaGrad** and **RMSProp** improve the stability of SGD by trying to incorpoate Hessian information in a computationally cheap way. 

- The **unversal approximation theorem** states that a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate continuous functions on compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, under mild assumptions on the activation function.

- Neural network model is a **projection pursuit** type additive model: 
$$
f(X) = \beta_0 + \sum_{m=1}^M \beta_m \sigma(\alpha_{m0} + \alpha_M^T X).
$$

## Multi-layer neural network

- Aka multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

- 1 hidden layer:

- 2 hidden layers:

## Practical issues

Neural networks are **not a fully automatic tool**, as they are sometimes advertised; as with all statistical models, subject matter knowledge should and often be used to improve their performance.

- Starting values: usually starting values for weights are chosen to be random values near zero; hence the model starts out nearly linear (for sigmoid), and becomes nonlinear as the weights increase.
    
- Overfitting (too many parameters):
    1. early stopping; 
    2. weight decay by $L_2$ penalty  
    $$
    L(\alpha, \beta) + \frac{\lambda}{2} \left( \sum_{k, m} \beta_{km}^2 + \sum_{m, l} \alpha_{ml}^2 \right).
    $$
    $\lambda$ is the **weight decay parameter**.  
    3. **Dropout**. At each training case, individual nodes are either dropped out of the net with probability $1-p$ or kept with probability $p$, so that a reduced network is left; incoming and outgoing edges to a dropped-out node are also removed. Forward and backpropagation for that training case are done only on this thinned network.

- Scaling of inputs: mean 0 and standard deviation 1. With standardized inputs, it is typical to take random uniform weights over the range [−0.7,+0.7].
    
- How many hidden units and how many hidden layers: guided by domain knowledge and experimentation.
    
- Multiple minima: try with different starting values.

## Convolutional neural networks (CNN)

Sources: <https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/>

- **Fully connected networks** don't scale well with dimension of input images. E.g. $96 \times 96$ images have about $10^4$ input units, and assuming you want to learn 100 features, you have about $10^6$ parameters to learn.

- In **locally connected networks**, each hidden unit only connects to a small contiguous region of pixels in the input, e.g., a patch of image or a time span of the input audio.

- **Convolutions**. Natural images have the property of being **stationary**, meaning that the statistics of one part of the image are the same as any other part. This suggests that the features that we learn at one part of the image can also be applied to other parts of the image, and we can use the same features at all locations by **weight sharing**.
<p align="center">
![](./ufldl-convolution-schematic.gif){width=400px}
</p>

    Consider $96 \times 96$ images. For each feature, first learn a $8 \times 8$ **feature detector** (or **filter** or **kernel**) from (possibly randomly sampled) $8 \times 8$ patches from the larger image. Then apply the learned detector to all $8 \times 8$ regions of the $96 \times 96$ image to obtain one $89 \times 89$ convolved feature for that feature. 
    
    From [Wang and Raj (2017)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.07800.pdf):  
    <p align="center">
    ![](./conv-bridge.png){width=700px}
    </p>
    

- **Pooling**. For a neural network with 100 hidden units, we have $89^2 \times 100 = 792,100$ convolved features. This can be reduced by calculating the mean (or max) vale of a particular feature over a region of the image. These summary statistics are much lower in dimension (compared to using all of the extracted features) and can also improve results (less over-fitting). We call this aggregation operation **pooling**, or sometimes **mean pooling** or **max pooling** (depending on the pooling operation applied).

- MLP (multi-layer perceptron) and CNN (convolutional neural network) are examples of **feed forward neural network**, where connections between the units do not form a cycle.  

- MLP and CNN accept a fixed-sized vector as input (e.g. an image) and produce a fixed-sized vector as output (e.g. probabilities of different classes). 

- **Reccurent neural networks (RNN)** instead have loops, which can be un-rolled into a sequence of MLP.
<p align="center">

- RNNs allow us to operate over sequences of vectors: sequences in the input, the output, or in the most general case both.

- Applications of RNN: 

    - [Language modeling and generating text](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/). E.g., search prompt, messaging prompt, ...

    - **Computer vision**: image captioning, video captioning,  ...
    <p align="center">
    ![](./image-captioning.png){width=500px}
    </p>

- RNNs accept an input vector $x$ and give you an output vector $y$. However, crucially this output vector’s contents are influenced not only by the input you just fed in, but also on the entire history of inputs you’ve fed in the past.
