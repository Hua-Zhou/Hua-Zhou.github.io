In this tutorial, we do some exploratory data analysis of the distributed data in a Hadoop YARN cluster. Again it is adapted from the [tutorial at RStudio](http://spark.rstudio.com/examples/yarn-cluster-emr/).

## Log in the Hadoop YARN cluster

- GCP YARN cluster master node has IP address `35.185.198.142` and has RStudio installed serving at [`http://35.185.198.142:8787`](http://35.185.198.142:8787).

- Your username is same as on the teaching server and the default password is `m280`. Change password via `passwd` command immediately after your first login.

- To work on your HW4 on the YARN master node, you may first want to `git clone` your `biostat-m280-2018-winter` repo.
