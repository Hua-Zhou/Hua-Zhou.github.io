## Why Linux ##

Linux is _the_ most common platform for scientific computing.

- For example, UCLA Hoffmann2 cluster runs on Linux. It is a lot computing power sitting there.

- Open source and community support.

- Thinks break; when they break using Linux, it's easy to fix them!

- Scalability: portable devices (Android, iOS), laptops, servers, and super computers.

- Cost: it's free!

## [Distributions of Linux](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Linux_Distribution_Timeline.svg) ##

- Debian/Ubuntu is a popular choice for personal computers.

- RHEL/CentOS is popular on servers.

- The teaching server for this class runs CentOS 7.

- Mac OS was originally derived from Unix/Linux (Darwin kernel). It is POSIX compliant. Most shell commands we review here apply to Mac OS terminal as well. Windows/DOS, unfortunately, is a totally different breed.

## ##

- On Linux:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cat /etc/*-release
```

- On Mac:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
sw_vers -productVersion
```
or
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType
```

## Linux directory structure ##

- Upon log in, user is at his/her home directory.

## Move around the file system ##

- `pwd` shows the current working directory
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

- `ls` lists contents of a directory.  
`ls -l` lists detailed contents of a directory.  
`ls -al` lists all contents of a directory, including those start with `.` (hidden folders).
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls
ls -l
ls -al
```
