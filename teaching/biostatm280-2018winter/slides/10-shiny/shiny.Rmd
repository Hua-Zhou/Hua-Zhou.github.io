## Why Shiny?

</p>

- Better presentations of data and ideas!
    - One of the most critical skills for data scientists.

- Josh Katz's [dialect quiz on NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html).

- [Another good representation of data](https://research.hackerrank.com/developer-skills/2018/).

## Inputs and outputs 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
numericInput("rows", "How many diamonds?", 5)

renderTable({
  head(diamonds, input$rows)
})
```

----

```{r, echo = FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", min = 1, max = 300, value = 30)

renderPlot({
  ggplot(data = diamonds) +
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), bins = input$bins)
})
```

- Check the [Shiny cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/shiny.pdf) for a list of inputs and outputs.

## Embedded shiny app

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(rmdexamples)
kmeans_cluster(iris)
```

## Building a Shiny app

- Basic parts of a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/basics.html>

- How to build a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/build.html>

- How to launch a shiny app: <http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/running.html>

----

- Skeleton of a Shiny app:
    ```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
    library(shiny)
    ui <- fluidPage()
    server <- function(input, output) {}
    shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
    ```

- A Shiny app has 3 components:

    1. `ui`: assemble the HTML user interface for your app.

    2. `server`: a function with instructions on how to build and rebuild the R objects displayed in the UI.

    3. `shinyApp`: combines `ui` and `server` into an app.

## Try yourself

1. In RStudio, `File` -> `New File` -> `Shiny Web App...` creates a demo Shiny app using the `faithful` data set in base R.

2. Deploy your Shiny app to [shinyapps.io](shinyapps.io).

## A slightly more complicated example

<http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson5/>

- `counties.rds` contains demographic data for each county in the United States from 2010 census:
    ```{r}
    counties <- readRDS("census-app/data/counties.rds")
    head(counties)
    ```

----

- Use `maps` package, `mapproj` package and `helpers.R` file to plot maps:
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(maps)
    library(mapproj)
    source("census-app/helpers.R")
    percent_map(counties$white, "darkgreen", "% White")
    ```

----

- Shiny app.
    ```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
    #setwd("census-app")
    #shinyAppDir(getwd())
    #shinyAppDir("census-app")
    #source("./census-app/app.R")
    runApp("census-app")
    ```

- [Code](https://github.com/Hua-Zhou/Hua-Zhou.github.io/tree/master/teaching/biostatm280-2018winter/slides/10-shiny/census-app) for the Shiny app `census-app`.

----

- The `shinyApp` function is run once, when you launch your app.  
- The `server` function is run once each time a user visits your app.  
- The R expressions inside `render*` functions are run many times. Shiny runs them once each time a user change the value of a widget. 
- Source scripts, load libraries, and read data sets at the beginning of `app.R` outside of the `server` function. Shiny will only run this code once, which is all you need to set your server up to run the R expressions contained in server.  
- Define user specific objects inside `server` function, but outside of any `render*` calls. These would be objects that you think each user will need their own personal copy of. For example, an object that records the userâ€™s session information. This code will be run once per user.

## An example using reactive expressions

- <http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson6/>

- [Code](https://github.com/Hua-Zhou/Hua-Zhou.github.io/tree/master/teaching/biostatm280-2018winter/slides/10-shiny/stockVis) for the Shiny app `stockVis`.

---

- Without using reactive expression:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      data <- getSymbols(input$symb, src = "google",
                         from = input$dates[1],
                         to = input$dates[2],
                         auto.assign = FALSE)
    
      chartSeries(data, theme = chartTheme("white"),
                  type = "line", log.scale = input$log, TA = NULL)
    })
    ```
Each time `renderPlot` re-runs:  
1. it re-fetches the data from Google finance with `getSymbols`, and
2. it re-draws the chart with the correct axis.

---- 

- With **reactive expression**:
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    dataInput <- reactive({
      getSymbols(input$symb, src = "google", 
                 from = input$dates[1],
                 to = input$dates[2],
                 auto.assign = FALSE)
    })
    
    output$plot <- renderPlot({
      chartSeries(dataInput(), theme = chartTheme("white"), 
                  type = "line", log.scale = input$log, TA = NULL)
    })
    ```

----

- A reactive expression saves its result the first time you run it.

- The next time the reactive expression is called, it checks if the saved value has become out of date (i.e., whether the widgets it depends on have changed).

- If the value is out of date, the reactive object will recalculate it (and then save the new result).

- If the value is up-to-date, the reactive expression will return the saved value without doing any computation.
