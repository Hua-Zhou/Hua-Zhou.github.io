## Common questions on HW1

1. Don't put large data or output files in version control. GitHub does not accept files larger than 100MB.

	<https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/>

	If you accidentally commit large files into your local repo, save the changes you want to keep somewhere else, delete the local repo, `git clone` again, and copy and commit the changed files.
	
	For HW1, only need to version control and submit `Rmd`, `R`, and `html` files.
