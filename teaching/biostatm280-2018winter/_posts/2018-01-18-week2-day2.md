## Confusion about instructor OH

Every Tue @ 12p-1p, 2:30p-3p; every Thu @ 2:30p-3p; 1/23, 2/6, 2/20, 3/6 @ 11a-12p.

## TA OH change (again)

Some students have class on Wed 11a-12p. To accomodate this, TA office hours change to: Wed 12p-1p, Thu 12p-1p @ CHS A1-241 (Computer Lab) effective from next week.

## Questions from last lecture

* Email notification when a job is done?

	* Hoffman2 will send an email notification when your submitted job is finished.

	* Use `mail` command
		```
		yourcommand 2>&1 | mail -s "yourcommand is done" yourname@example.com
		```
assuming `mail` program is installed and properly set up on the server.

	* Read post: <https://superuser.com/questions/345447/how-can-i-trigger-a-notification-when-a-job-process-ends>

* `nohup` output appends to the `nohup.out` file.

* Submit jobs sequentially.
```{r}
system(command, wait=TRUE)
```

* More options for Windows.

    * [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org)  
    * [Bitvise SSH Client](http://www.putty.org): SSH + SFTP GUI
    * [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net): SSH and Xterm
    * [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com): Linux platform within Windows
