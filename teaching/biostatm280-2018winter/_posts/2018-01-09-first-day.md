## Homework (not graded)

* Fill out a short [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/V77BLQ3). It helps me better taylor the course to your background.

  0. Download and install R v3.4.3 from [http://cran.stat.ucla.edu](http://cran.stat.ucla.edu)

  0. An account has been created for those enrolled in the class. The username is same as that in your email address. The temporary password is same as your username. E.g., if you email is `joe_bruin@ucla.edu`, then the username for your account on teaching server is `joe_bruin` and the temporary password is `joe_bruin`.  
  0. Change your password as soon as possible:  
  ..0. `ssh username@35.227.165.60`
  ..0. After log in using your temporary password, issue command `passwd` to change your password to a more secure one.

  ..0. Later we will learn how to set up the more secure key authentification.
