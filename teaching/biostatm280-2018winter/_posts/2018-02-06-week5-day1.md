## Announcements

* [HW2](http://hua-zhou.github.io/teaching/biostatm280-2018winter/schedule.html) is posted; due Feb 16.

* M280 in **spring quarter**. Used as a placeholder for new course _Biostat 257: Computational Methods for Biostatistical Research_. It focuses on **algorithms**, instead of software tools. I'll use Julia.

## Today

* Data transformation with dplyr (cont'd).

* Import and tidy data.

* String manipulations using stringr.
