## Common questions on HW1

1. R Studio freezes.

2. Break long code into multiple lines.  

What's the result of following R code?
```{r}
x <- 1 + 2
  + 3 + 4
x
```  
How about?  
```{r}
x <- 1 + 2 + 
  3 + 4
x
```

3. Pass string arguments to R from command line.

4. Wifi `UCLA-Web` blocks port 8787 used by R Studio server.

## About debugging

* Remember: it's always always you, never the computer.

* Be systematic. Build on incremental changes.

* Be sure it's fixed, running without an error is not fixed!

* Be tenacious, you'll find it ... eventually.


## Tips on HWs

* Start early! 

* Ask for help. You are most likely to get good help if you provide a **minimal reproducible example**.
