This tutorial details the steps to establish SSH authentication for connecting to a Linux machine from a Windows machine. 

We assume that programs `PuTTY` and `PuTTYgen` are installed on the Windows machine. 

0. Generate a pair of SSH keys. If you already have them on the Linux machine, you can skip this step. Log in to a Linux machine and generate an SSH key pair named `id_rsa` by
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f id_rsa -C yourname
```
Replace `yourname` by any comment you want. This will produce a public key file `id_rsa.pub` and a private key file `id_rsa`. The public key needs to be in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on any Linux machine you want to connect.

0. Now we want to put the private key on the Windows machine so we can use it to connect to the Linux machine. You can use `WinSCP` or any other program to transfer this file to your Windows machine, or simply copy the content of `id_rsa` and paste to a text file on Windows. Let's assume the private key file on Windows machine is still named `id_rsa`. 

0. Unfortunately the private key format used by `PuTTY` is different from that of Linux. We use the `PuTTYgen` program to convert it to an appropriate format for `PuTTY`. Open `PuTTYgen`, go to menu `Conversions` -> `Import Key`, and select the `id_rsa` file. Click the `Save private key` button to save it as say `id_rsa_putty.ppk`. This is the private key file `PuTTY` will use.

0. Open `PuTTY` 

	0. enter Host Name (or IP address)

	0. From `Connection` -> `Data`, enter your username on the Linux machine to `Auto-login username`.

	0. From `Connection` -> `SSH` -> `Auth`, load the `id_rsa_putty.ppk` file to `Private key file for authentication`.

	0. From `Session`, provide a session name to `Saved Sessions` and click `Save`. 

	0. Now each time double-clicking the saved session will connect to the Linux machine via SSH key.
