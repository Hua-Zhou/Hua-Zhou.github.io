## Checklist on your resume/cv

- [ ] Git/GitHub (give your GitHub handle)  
- [ ] HPC (if you did HW2 Q4)  
- [ ] Shiny app  
- [ ] SQL databases  
- [ ] Apache Hadoop + Spark  
- [ ] Cloud Computing (GCP, AWS?, Azure?)  
- [ ] Docker  
- [ ] Deep learing with Keras+TensorFlow+GPU (if you did HW5???)  

* Make your GitHub repo `biostat-m280-2018-winter` public (after final week) and show your work to backup your resume.

* **Use** these skills in your daily work: use Git/GitHub for all your daily work (homework, research projects), give presentation using R Markdown and Shiny, write blog/tutorial on GitHub, ...

* Stop your own GCP instances and release un-used static IPs to avoid charges.

* I'll shut down YARN cluster and the teaching server soon. Make sure you back up your stuff.

## What I didn't cover

- Scraping data from web (Google, Twitter, Facebook).

- Machine/statistical learning methods. Familiar with methods in _Elements of Statistical Learning_ and software, e.g., _scikit-learn_.

- Algorithms. 

- Public health applications.

- Be open to languages. Python is a more generic programming language and widely adopted in data science. Scala is popular for implementing distributed programs. Julia is attractive for high performance scientific computing.
