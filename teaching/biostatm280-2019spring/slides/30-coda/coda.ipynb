    "    * Convex programming (LS, LP, QP, GP, SOCP, SDP). Download and study Stephen Boyd's book, watch lecture vides or take UCLA EE236B by Vandenberghe, familiarize yourself with the **good** optimization softwares. Convex programming is becoming a **technology**, just like least squares (LS). Browse the documentation of `cvx` and `Convex.jl` to see which functions are implemented.\n",
