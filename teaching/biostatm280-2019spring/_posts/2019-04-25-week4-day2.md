## Today

* QR decomposition.

* Sweep operator.

* Summary of linear regression.

## Announcement

* [Performance tip: Types with values as parameters](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/#Types-with-values-as-parameters-1).

* TA office hours change to Wed @ 11a-1p.

* HW1 graded. Common issues: Q3 (llvm unroll the loop or not), Q4 (cancellation), Git issues (tagging, folder, commits, aux. files), Q5-Q7 needs mathematical proof not code.

	You can amend your homework and get bonus points.

* Use PyPlot `imshow` to display image in Jupyter notebook.

* My runtime of the NNMF example:

```julia
using BenchmarkTools, DelimitedFiles

# data matrix
X = readdlm("nnmf-2429-by-361-face.txt", ' ', Float64)
# provided start point
V0full = readdlm("V0.txt", ' ', Float64)
W0full = readdlm("W0.txt", ' ', Float64)
# benchmark
@benchmark nnmf(X, r; V=V0, W=W0) setup=(V0 = V0full[:, 1:r]; W0 = W0full[1:r, :])
```
gives benchmark result

```julia
BenchmarkTools.Trial: 
  memory estimate:  7.12 MiB
  allocs estimate:  8
  --------------
  minimum time:     1.548 s (0.00% GC)
  median time:      1.581 s (0.00% GC)
  mean time:        1.582 s (0.17% GC)
  maximum time:     1.620 s (0.00% GC)
  --------------
  samples:          4
  evals/sample:     1
```
It took 394 iterations to converge. I expect similar runtime and memory allocation in your homework submission.
