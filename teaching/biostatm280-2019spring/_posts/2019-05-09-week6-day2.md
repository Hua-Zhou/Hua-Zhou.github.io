## Today

* Eigen-decomposition and SVD (cont'd).

* Optimization introduction. 

## Announcement

* HW2 graded. Common issues:  
	* Late submission. Remember to `git tag`.    
	* NNMF: local minimum due to non-convexity; `V * W * W'` vs `V * (W * W')`; use in-place functions `mul!` to reduce allocation of intermediate arrays; basis images show parts of face;  GPU coding.      
	* Multivariate normal density. Using Woodbury structure should see ~100 fold speedup compared to standard way to evaluate normal density.  

	You can re-work on homework problems and re-submit for bonus points.

* HW3 due Wed 5/15 @ 11:59PM. PageRank problem: it took me <6 seconds to obtain solution using GMRES and <16 seconds using Arnoldi. The key is to use the LinearMaps.jl to define fast matrix-vector multiplication utilizing the Woodbury structure (sparse + rank 1).

* HW4 posted (SVD). Due Fri 5/24 @ 11:59PM.

* Next Tue (5/14)'s class ends at 1:45p. [Xiao-Li Meng' talk](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu/content/2pm-315pm-statbiostat-joint-seminar-how-small-are-our-big-data-turning-2016-surprise-2020) 2p-3:15p.
